# Motivation 

+ The idea that causality is interesting is easy to motivate.

+ The question "Why?" motivates nearly all scientific endeavors. 

+ Causal inference formalizes what it means to answer this "Why?" question.

+ The idea that we need this formalization is much newer than the idea that causal questions are interesting. 

---

# Example: Smoking and Lung Cancer

--

+ In 1900 only 140 cases of lung cancer were known in published medical literature. 

--

+ By the 1920's incidence of lung cancer had increased dramatically. 

--

+ Smoking was a hypothesized cause of lung cancer as early as 1912...

--

+ But so were:
  - Air pollution 
  - Asphalt dust from new roads
  - Poison gas from WWI
  - Influenza pandemic of 1918
  - Increasing use of radiography 
  - Increasing clinical awareness of lung cancer
  - Aging population


---

# The Case Against Smoking

--

- Observational studies showed a strong association between smoking and lung cancer. 

  + Earliest studies used a case/control design. 
  + Followed by prospective studies matching healthy smokers and non-smokers by age, sex, and occupation and following them over time. 
  + All studies observed a large and robust association between smoking and lung cancer (Doll and Hill estimate an OR of 40 in 1954).

--

- Supporting evidence comes from animal studies in the 1930's and 1940's: Exposing animals to tobacco products causes cancer.  

--

- Even more evidence from chemical analysis in the 1940's and 1950's: Cigarette smoke contains known cancer causing chemicals.
  + Much of this work is done by tobacco companies themselves.

--

- By the 1950's tobacco companies also believe that tobacco use causes cancer. This information is kept secret.

---

# Challenges to the Smoking-Lung Cancer Link

- Tobacco companies invested large amounts of money into research and advertising challenging the link between smoking and lung cancer. 

- In the 1960's only one third of doctors believed smoking to be a major cause of lung cancer.

- RA Fisher was a famous challenger of the smoking $\rightarrow$ lung cancer hypothesis:

 + Fisher pointed to a genetic factor linked to both smoking and lung cancer, arguing this factor may be a common cause of both. 
 + This concern about confounding is valid, but the effect size would need to be enormous.
 + The genetic hypothesis is also inconsistent with earlier low rates of lung cancer, animal studies, and reduced cancer rates in quitters.
 + It also disregards the possibility that smoking may be mediating the gene-cancer association.

---

# Why did Fisher (and others) Get it Wrong?


- Some have suggested that Fisher had conflicts of interest -- he had done work as a tobacco industry consultant and was himself a smoker. 

- Fisher's statement that the association between smoking and lung cancer could be explained by a common cause is correct. 

- But that model is inconsistent with many other lines of evidence. 

---

# Lessons 

--

- Causal inference cannot be achieved through only statistical procedures. It requires a model, assumptions, and information external to the study.

--

- All causal analyses of observational data require un-provable assumptions. 

--

- Many interesting and important questions cannot be answered in a randomized trial.

  + We need theory and language that allows us to test causal hypotheses in observational data. 

---

# Early Foundations of Causal Theory


- Neyman 1923: Notation and formalization of potential outcomes introduced.

- Fisher 1925: Physical randomization of units as the "reasoned basis" for inference.

- Wright 1921: Introduced graphical models and path analysis.

---

# Languages of Causality

--

+ Potential Outcomes/counterfactuals:
  - Proposes the existence of unobserved outcomes for each unit under different possible exposures or treatments.
  - First formalized by Neyman (1923), further developed by Donald Rubin (1974 and onward) and others.
  - "Rubin causal model". 

--
+ Graphs:
  - Represents causal relationships between observed and unobserved variables as directed edges in a graph. 
  - Causal interventions are represented as modifications of the graph. 
  - Introduced by Wright (1921), further developed by Judea Pearl (1988 and onward) and others.

--
+ Structural Equations:
   - Represents causal relationships as a series of equations describing conditional probability distributions.
   - Also introduced by Wright in 1921.
   - More work by Pearl, Haavelmo, Duncan, and many more.

--
+ Under some conditions, all three languages are equivalent/mutually compatible.

# Counterfactuals/Potential Outcomes

+ What does it mean to say that $A$ causes $Y$?

--

+ A counterfactual value, $Y_i(A_i = a)$ is the value of $Y$ the $i$th individual **would have had** if $A$ had been **intervened on** and set to $a$.

--

+ Many equivalent notations:
  - $Y(A = a)$, $Y(a)$: I will primarily use these notations. 
  - $Y^a$: This is the main notation in Hernán and Robins.
  - $Y\vert \ do(A = a)$: This notation emphasizes the intervention of setting $A$ equal to $a$ and is favored by Judea Pearl. There are some subtle differences between the "do operator" and counterfactuals. 

--

+ A counterfactual fundamentally supposes a hypothetical intervention (treatment).



<!-- + I will (try to) stick with $Y(A = a)$ or $Y(a)$ when the meaning is unambiguous.  -->

<!-- -- -->

<!-- + We can only observe $Y_i$ under a single value of $A_i$, so $Y_i(A_i = a)$ is missing for all but one value of $a$. -->

---

# Example

For each person we observe:

+ If they wear a helmet when biking ( $A_i = 1$ ) or not ( $A_i = 0$ ).

+ If they sustain a head trauma in a given year ( $Y_i = 1$ )  or not ( $Y_i = 0$ ).

+ Below is the full table of counterfatual outcomes:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
bike_data <- data.frame(Ind = 1:8, Y_0 = c(1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1), Y_1 = c(1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0) )
knitr::kable(bike_data, col.names = c("", "\\(Y(A=0)\\)", "\\(Y(A=1)\\)"), format = 'html')
```


---
# Individual vs Average Treatment Effects

+ Sharp causal null: No effect of treatment for any individual, $Y_i(A_i = 1) = Y_i(A_i = 0)$ for all $i$. 

+ Average causal null: The average causal effect is zero, $E[Y(A = 0)] = E[Y(A = 1)]$.

+ In our example, the sharp null is false, but the average null is true.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
bike_data <- data.frame(Ind = 1:8, Y_0 = c(1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1), Y_1 = c(1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0) )
knitr::kable(bike_data, col.names = c("", "\\(Y(A=0)\\)", "\\(Y(A=1)\\)"), format = 'html')
```
---

# Measures of Treatment Effects

+ Average treatment effect (ATE): $E[Y(1)] - E[Y(0)] = E[Y_i(A1) - Y_i(0)]$

+ Risk ratio (RR): $E[Y(0)]/E[Y(1)]$

+ Odds ratio (OR; for binary outcomes): $\frac{E[Y(1)]/(1-E[Y(1)])}{E[Y(0)]/(1-E[Y(0)]}$

+ Null hypotheses ATE $=0$, RR $=1$, and OR $=1$ are equivalent.

+ The ATE can be interpreted either as the difference in average outcome between groups or as the average difference.

+ This is not true for RR and OR -- RR is not equal to the average risk ratio over the population.

---

# Counterfactuals and Missing Data 

+ The counterfactual framework turns causal inference into a missing data problem. 

+ Even if we were able to observe $A$ and $Y$ for the entire population, uncertainty would remain in our estimate of the ATE because we cannot observe both $Y_i(1)$ and $Y_i(0)$ for the same individual. 

+ This has been called the "fundamental problem of causal inference."


---

# Sample vs Population Treatment Effect

+ We very rarely sample the entire population of interest. 

+ Sample average treatment effect (SATE): $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^{n} Y_i(1) - \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^{n} Y_i(0)$

+ Population average treatment effect (PATE): $E[Y(1)] - E[Y(0)]$, with expectation is taken over a super-population. 

+ Identifying the population is a scientific (rather than a statistical) task.

---

# Non-Deterministic Counterfactuals

+ So far we have seen two sources of uncertainty in the ATE: 
  
  - Missing counterfactual outcomes
  - Sampling variation
  
+ A third source is randomness in the counterfactual outcome. 

+ Rather than thinking of $Y_i(A_i = a)$ as a deterministic value, we can think of it as a random variable with individual specific (random) cdf $F_{Y_i(a)}(y)$. 

+ We will abbreviate $F_{Y_i(a)}(y)$ to $F_{a,i}$. 

---

# Non-Deterministic Counterfactuals

+ If $Y_i(A_i = a)$ is a random variable, the ATE is a double expectation:
 $$E[Y(A = a)] = E\left \lbrace E[ Y_i(A_i = a) \vert F_{a,i} ] \right \rbrace$$
with the inside expectation taken over the distribution of $Y_i(A_i = a)$ and the outer expectation taken over the population. 

+ Let $F_{a} = E[F_{a,i}]$ be the average counterfactual cdf. 

$$E[Y(A =a)] = E\left[\int y \ dF_{a,i}(y) \right] = \int y \ dE[F_{a,i}(y)] = \int y \ dF_a(y)$$
+ So, the average counterfactual value is the expectation w.r.t the average counterfactual cdf. 

+ The distinction between deterministic and non-deterministic counterfactuals doesn't matter for average effects.

Average causal effect: $E[Y(A = 1)] - E[Y(A = 0)] = `r mean(Y_1)` - `r mean(Y_0)` = `r mean(Y_1) - mean(Y_0)`$

Observed association: $E[Y \vert A = 1] - E[Y \vert A = 0] = `r round(mean(Y_1[helmet == 1]), digits = 2)` - `r round(mean(Y_0[helmet == 0]), digits = 2)` = `r round(mean(Y_1[helmet == 1]) - mean(Y_0[helmet == 0]), digits =2)`$

---
# Conditions for Identifying the Causal Effect

+ Suppose we only observe $A$ and $Y$. When is it possible to estimate the ATE?

--

+ We must be able to estimate $E[Y(a)]$ for all values of $a$. Therefore, we must have 
$$ E[Y(a)] = E[Y \vert A = a]$$

--

+ This is true under three assumptions:

  - Consistency
  - Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA)
  - Exchangeability (exogeneity)

  
---
# Consistency

+ The observed value of $Y_i$ is the same as the counterfactual value of $Y_i$ under the treatment $a_i$, where $a_i$ is the treatment individual $i$ actually recieved. 

$$Y_i = Y_i(A_i = a_i)$$

--

Bike example:
+ A person's chances of head injury are the same if they wear a helmet of their own accord or if they are required to wear a helmet.

--
 
+ Whether or not consistency holds may depend on the nature of the hypothesized intervention. 

---
# Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption

1. There are no different versions of treatment available to an individual and the treatment level $a$ is unambiguous for all values of $a$.

--

1. No interference: The counterfactual outcome for unit $i$, $Y_i (A_i = a)$ is independent of the treatment received by other units in the study.

--

  + Formally, let $\mathbf{A} = (A_1, \dots, A_n)$ be the vector of treatment assignments for all units with $\mathbf{a}$ being a single realization of $\mathbf{A}$. Let $a_i$ be the $i$th element of $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathcal{A}^n$ be the sample space of $\mathbf{A}$. Let $Y_i(\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{a})$ be the counterfactual value of $Y_i$ under the treatment vector $\mathbf{a}$. No interference is the condition that 

$$
Y_i(\mathbf{A}= \mathbf{a}) = Y_i(A_i = a_i) \ \  \ \forall\ \ \mathbf{a} \in \mathcal{A}^{n}
$$

--

Pair discussion:

+ What do these assumptions look like in the bike helmet example?

+ Can you think of a time "No interference" may not hold?

---

# Exchangeability

+ Exchangeability: $Y(a) \ci A$. 

--

+ Question: How is $Y(a) \ci A$ different from $Y \ci A$?

--

+ Mean exchangeability: $E[Y(a) \vert A = a^\prime] = E[Y(a) \vert A = a^{\prime \prime}]$ for all pairs $a^\prime, a^{\prime \prime} \in \mathcal{A}.$

--

+ Mean exchangeability is sufficient to prove $E[Y(a)] = E[Y \vert A = a].$ 

--

+ For dichotomous $Y$, mean exchangeability and exchangeability are equivalent. 

--

+ What about for non-dichotomous $Y$?

--

+ Full exchangeability: Let $Y^{\mathcal{A}} = \left \lbrace Y(a), Y(a^\prime), \dots \right \rbrace$ be the set of all counterfactual outcomes ( $Y^{\mathcal{A}} = \left \lbrace Y(1), Y(0) \right \rbrace$ for a dichotomous treatment). Full exchangeability states that 

$$
Y^{\mathcal{A}} \ci A 
$$


---

# Exchangeability in the Bike Helmet Example:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
kable(X[1:10,], col.names = c("", "\\(Y(A=0)\\)", "\\(Y(A=1)\\)"), format = 'html') %>%
  kable_styling(position = "float_left", full_width = FALSE) %>%
  column_spec(2, bold = ifelse(helmet[1:10] == 0, TRUE, FALSE), 
             color = ifelse(helmet[1:10] == 0, "black", "grey")) %>% 
  column_spec(3, bold = ifelse(helmet[1:10] == 1, TRUE, FALSE), 
             color = ifelse(helmet[1:10] == 1, "black", "grey"))

kable(X[11:20,], col.names = c("", "\\(Y(A=0)\\)", "\\(Y(A=1)\\)"), format = 'html', row.names = FALSE) %>%
  kable_styling(position = "right", full_width = FALSE) %>%
  column_spec(2, bold = ifelse(helmet[11:20] == 0, TRUE, FALSE), 
              color = ifelse(helmet[11:20] == 0, "black", "grey")) %>% 
  column_spec(3, bold = ifelse(helmet[11:20] == 1, TRUE, FALSE), 
              color = ifelse(helmet[11:20] == 1, "black", "grey"))

```

$E[Y(A = 0) \vert A = 0] = `r round(mean(Y_0[helmet == 0]), digits = 2)`$,   $E[Y(A = 0) \vert A = 1] = `r round(mean(Y_0[helmet == 1]), digits = 2)`$

$E[Y(A = 1) \vert A = 0] = `r round(mean(Y_1[helmet == 0]), digits = 2)`$,   $E[Y(A = 1) \vert A = 1] = `r round(mean(Y_1[helmet == 1]), digits = 2)`$

---

# Identification Theorem

Theorem: If consistency, SUTVA, and exchangeability hold, then $$Y(a) \overset{d}{=} Y | A = a,$$ where $\overset{d}{=}$ means equal in distribution. 

--

Proof: 

$$P[Y(a) \leq y] = P[Y(a) \leq y \vert A = a] \ \ \ \text{(exchangeability)}$$
$$= P[Y \leq y \vert A = a] \ \ \  \text{(consistency)}$$
--

Corrolary: If consistency, SUTVA, and exchangeability hold then $E[Y(a)] = E[Y \vert A = a]$

---

# Where did SUTVA come in?

+ If the levels of $A$ are not clearly defined, the causal question is ill-defined (i.e. $Y(a)$ is poorly defined). 

+ In the presence of interference, there is no single value of $Y_i(a_i)$. Instead, we must discuss $Y_i(\mathbf{a})$, the potential outcome given the entire vector of treatment assignments.


---

# Simple Randomized Experiments

+ Units are assigned a treatment value using a randomization procedure that is independent of all unit characteristics (e.g. flip a coin).

+ For now, we assume full compliance (everyone assigned treatment $a$ receives treatment $a$).

+ Exchangeability holds by design. 

+ So, we can estimate the ATE as long as consistency and SUTVA hold.

+ One estimator is just the difference in average outcomes (more on estimators in HW1):
$$\frac{1}{n_{1}}\sum_{i: A_i = 1}Y_i - \frac{1}{n_2}\sum_{i:A_i = 0}Y_i = \bar{Y}_1 - \bar{Y}_0$$

---

# Conditionally Randomized Experiments


+ Units are assigned a treatment with probability depending on a set of features, $X$.

+ If $X$ and $Y(a)$ are not independent, then exchangeability does not (generally) hold.

+ However, we can still identify the ATE if we have access to the randomization features $X$. 

---

# Example

+ We are doing an experiment of a new treatment for a disease. Some patients will receive the new treatment ( $A = 1$ ), 
while the rest will receive standard of care ( $A = 0$ ).

+ Let $L = 0$ indicate that a patient is less sick and $L = 1$ indicate that they are more sick.

+ We decide on a randomization scheme in which sicker patients are more likely to receive the new treatment. We set $P(A = 1 \vert L = 0) = 0.5$ and $P(A = 1 \vert L = 1) = 0.75$.

+ We observe if each patient dies before a set time point ( $Y = 1$ for death, $Y = 0$ for survival).




---

# Conditional Exchangeability

+ Notice that our trial looks like two fully randomized trials combined. 
  
    - In one trial, the target population is patients with $L = 0$ and the treatment probability is 0.5.
    - In the other, the target population is patients with $L = 1$ and the treatment probability is 0.75.

--

+ Conditional exchangeability captures the idea that data are randomized *within* levels of $L$.

--


+ Conditional exchangeability holds with respect to a set of variables $L$, if

$$Y(a) \ci A\ \vert\ L$$
---
# Stratum Specific Causal Effects and Standardization

+ Exchangeability holds within levels of $L$, so $E[Y(a) \vert L = l]$ is identifiable.

--

+ If we want to estimate the population level marginal counterfactual value of $Y$ under treatment $A = a$, we can simply weight our estimates
by the population frequency of $L$:
$$
E[Y(a)] = \sum_{l}E[Y(a) \vert L = l]P[L = l]
$$
--

+ This is called the standardized mean (standardized by whatevery population frequencies of $L$ you choose).

---


# Positivity

+ Of course, the standardization trick doesn't work if, within one level of $L$, patients never (or always) receive treatment.

--

+ The positivity condition states that at all individuals have some chance of receiving any treatment: 

$$P[A = a \vert L = l] > 0 \ \ \forall a, l$$


---

# Identification Theorem (Conditional)

Theorem: If consistency, SUTVA, conditional exchangeability, *and positivity* hold, then $$Y(a) \vert\ L =l \overset{d}{=} Y |\ L = l, A = a.$$ 

--

We can use exactly the same proof as the non-conditional theorem, conditioning on $L$ in each step.

Proof: 

$$P[Y(a) \leq y \vert L = l] = P[Y(a) \leq y \vert L=l, A = a] \ \ \ \text{(conditional exchangeability)}$$
$$= P[Y \leq y \vert L=l, A = a] \ \ \  \text{(consistency)}$$

---

# Inverse Probability Weighting 

+ Rather than using the standardization method, we can think of our trial as a weighted sampling from a larger, fully randomized trial with $2N$ participants.

+ This *pseudo-population* contains two members for every member in our trial, one receiving each treatment. 

+ In the pseudo-population, $Y(a) \ci A$ so the conditional mean, $E[Y \vert A = a]$ estimates the counterfactual mean $E[Y(a)]$.

---

# Inverse Probability Weighting 

+ We can imagine that each individual in our trial was sampled from the larger population with probability conditional on $L$ and $A$.
 
 - In our study we selected half of participants with $A_i = 0$ and $L_i = 0$
 - Half of participants with $A_i = 1$ and $L = 0$
 - One quarter of participants with $A_i = 0$ and $L = 1$ 
 - Three quarters of participants with $A_i = 1$ and $L = 1$

--

+ We can recover the estimate from the pseudo-population by weighting each participant by the number of units in the larger study that they represent:
  
  - $A_i=0$, $L_i=0$: $1/0.5 = 2$
  - $A_i = 1$, $L_i = 0$: $1/0.5 = 2$
  - $A_i = 0$, $L_i = 1$: $1/0.25 = 4$
  - $A_i = 1$, $L_i = 0$: $1/0.75 = 1.33$


---

# Inverse Probability Weighting 

+ Formally, let $f_{A \vert L}(a\vert l)$ be the conditional pdf of $A$ given $L$. 

+ We assume that $f_{A \vert L}(a\vert l) > 0$ for all $a$ and $l$ s.t $P[L = l] > 0$. 

+ The IP weighting for individual $i$ is $W^A_i = 1/f_{A\vert L}(a_i \vert l_i)$.

+ The IP weighted mean for treatment level $a$ is $E\left[\frac{I(A=a)Y}{f(A\vert L)}\right]$

---

# Equivalence of IP Weighting and Standardization

+ We will assume that $A$ and $L$ are discrete and $f(a \vert l) = P[A = a \vert L = l] > 0$ for all $l$ with $P[L = l] > 0$.

+ Use the iterated expectation formula:


$$E\left[\frac{I(A=a)Y}{f(A\vert L)}\right] = E_L \left \lbrace E_{A} \left\lbrace E_{Y}\left[\frac{I(A=a)Y}{f(A\vert L)} \vert A, L \right]\right\rbrace \right\rbrace$$
$$=\sum_l \frac{E[Y\vert A = a, L = l]}{f(a\vert l)} f(a \vert l) P[L = l]$$
$$= \sum_l E[Y\vert A = a, L = l] P[L = l]$$

+ This proof extends to continuous $L$ but not to continuous $A$ (see HW 1).

+ If conditional exchangeability holds, then both the IP weighted mean and the standardized mean estimate $Y(a)$.


---

# Causal Effects from in an Observational Data

+ None of our four identification conditions consistency, SUTVA, conditional exchangeability, and positivity require that our data is from a randomized trial.

+ However, these are much stronger assumptions in observational data. 
---

# The Target Trial

- Hernán and Robins argue that in order to identify a causal effect in observational data, we must have in mind a target trial that would identify the same parameter if it were feasible. 

- This includes clearly and specifically defining a hypothetical intervention. 

- This is often tricky (but not necessarily impossible): What is the target intervention in the statements
  
  + "Earning a college degree will increase your earnings."
  + "He was pulled over because he is Black."
  + "Obesity causes heart disease".

---

# Consistencey
  
- Consistency says: The outcome we observed for unit $i$ ( $Y_i$ ), who received treatment $a$ is the same as the outcome we *would have observed* if we had intervened and set $A_i$ to $a$.

- In a trial with an intervention, consistency is almost tautological. 
    
    + We *did* intervene and set $A_i$ to $a$. 

- In an observational study we should think about if consistency is justified. 

  + People may change their behavior if they receive an intervention vs. choosing a behavior independently.
  
---
# Conditional Exchangeability

+ In a trial, exchangeability is guaranteed by the study design. 
  - The researchers control the assignment mechanism and therefore know all of the features which contribute to treatment probabilities.
  
+ In observational studies, treatment assignment occurs "naturally".
  - Identifying a set of variables to give conditional exchangeability requires assumptions and external information.
  - It may not be possible to measure all necessary variables.

# Positivity

+ In a trial, positivity is guaranteed by design. 

+ In observational data, even if we know a set $L$ of variables such that $Y(a) \ci A\ \vert \ L$, there may be levels $L$ for which $P(A = a \vert L = l)$ is close to or exactly zero.
