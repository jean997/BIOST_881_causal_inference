# Modeling

- So far we have learned two strategies for estimating `\(E[Y(a)]\)` from data when we need to adjust for
confounding or selection bias. 

- In IP weighting we re-weight our observations by `\(1/P[A = A_i \vert L_i]\)`, the probability that 
they received the treatment that they got given confounderts `\(L_i\)`. 

- In standardization, we first stratify the data by `\(L\)`, compute `\(E[Y \vert A = a, L]\)` within each stratum, and then take a weighted sum of these averages. 

- In both of these approaches, we have stayed totally non-parametric so far.

---
# Non-Parametric Models

- Our methods so far have been *non-parametric* because we haven't had to make any assumptions about the 
form of quantities like `\(E[Y \vert A, L]\)`.

- We just estimate one value for every level of `\(A\)` and `\(L\)`.

- This is also called a *saturated* model. 

- With this strategy, we can be sure that the true probability distribution is within th class we are searching.

- So with enough data and the correct model, we will always converge to the true effect. 

---

# Limitations of Non-Parametric Models

- Non-parametric models are limited in the complexity of data they can handle.

- We can only handle variables with a small number of discrete levels. 

- We will need to make some assumptions to handle more complex data. 

- The validity of our inference will depend on these assumptions being correct. 

- But many parametric models are still flexible enough to do well. 


---
# NHEFS Data

- Cigarette smokers aged 25-74 were recruited around 1971 and given a survey. 

- Ten years later, participants were given a followup survey. 

- We are interested in estimating the effect of quitting smoking on weight change on the additive scale. 


---

# Variables

- Our exposure is binary (whether or not a person quit smoking between the first and second survey).

- The outcome is the change in weight in kg. 


- What other features you would want to know in order to estimate the causal effect. 

--

- For now we will assume that the following variables are sufficient: 

+ Sex (0: male, 1: female)
+ Age (in years)
+ Race (0: white, 1: other)
+ Education (5 categories)
+ Intensity of smoking (cigarettes per day)
+ Duration of smoking (years)
+ Physical activity in daily life (3 categories)
+ Recreational exercise (3 categories)
+ Weight (kg)

---
# Limitations

- We are only analyzing individuals who responded to the second survey.

  + For individuals who did not respond, we have neither exposure nor outcome data. 
  + We will talk more about this later but for now are ignoring it. 

- Individuals may have quit at different times. 

  + We could think of `\(A\)` as a time-varying treatment (coming up later). 

---
# Simple Analysis

- The simplest analysis is to simply compare the mean weight change between quitters and non-quitters. 


&lt;table&gt;
 &lt;thead&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:right;"&gt; Quit Smoking &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:right;"&gt; Average Weight Change &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:right;"&gt; N &lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 0 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 1.98 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 1163 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 1 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 4.53 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 403 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

# Inverse Probability Weighting

- Recall, the goal of IP weighting is to create a pseudo-population in which confounders `\(L\)` and
treatment `\(A\)` are independent. 

- If `\(Y(a) \ci A \vert L\)`, then in the pseudo-population, `\(E[Y(a)]  = E_{ps}[Y \vert A]\)`. 

- In the pseudo-population, association is causation, 

`$$E[Y(1)]-E[Y(0)] = E_{ps}[Y \vert A = 1] - E_{ps}[Y \vert A = 0]$$`

---
# Estimating Weights

- In our data, `\(L\)` is a vector of nine measurements. 

- We cannot compute `\(P[A = 1 \vert L ]\)` among every (or any) stratum of `\(L\)` because every
participant has their own unique value of `\(L\)`. 

- We have to fit a parametric model. 

- What would you do? 

---

# Weights Estimated by Logistic Regression 

- We will use a logistic regression model to predict `\(P[A \vert L]\)`

- The goal is to get the best possible estimate of the probability of treatment so 
we should fit a flexible model. 


```r
fit &lt;- glm(qsmk ~ sex + race + age + I(age ^ 2) +
    as.factor(education) + smokeintensity +
    I(smokeintensity ^ 2) + smokeyrs + I(smokeyrs ^ 2) +
    as.factor(exercise) + as.factor(active) + wt71 + I(wt71 ^ 2),
    family = binomial(), data = dat)

dat$w &lt;- ifelse(dat$qsmk == 0, 
                1/(1 - predict(fit, type = "response")), 
                1/(predict(fit, type = "response")))
```


```
##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
##   1.054   1.230   1.373   1.996   1.990  16.700
```

---

# Positivity 

- *Structural violations* of positivity occur when it is impossible for people with some 
levels of confounders to receive a particular level of treatment. 

  + If we have structural violations, we cannot use IP weighting or standardization. 
  + We need to restrict our inference to relevant strata of `\(L\)`. 

- *Random violations* of positivity occur when certain combinations of `\(L\)` and `\(A\)` 
are missing from our data by chance. 

  + We are using a parametric model, so we are able to smooth over the zeroes. 
  + We are able to predict for strata that were not observed in our data. 
  + We should be careful about predicting outside the range of the observed data. 


---

# Horvitz-Thompson Estimator

- The *Horvitz-Thompson estimator* is one of two options for estimating `\(E[Y(a)]\)` using our 
estimated weights.

- The Horvitz-Thompson estimator just plugs our estimated weights into our previous formula.

$$
\hat{E}[Y(a)] = \hat{E}\left[\frac{I(A = a)Y}{f(A\vert L)} \right] = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^n I(A_i = a)Y_i W_i
$$

---

# Hajek Estimator

- The *Hajek estimator* fits the linear model 
$$
E[Y \vert A] = \theta_0 + \theta_1 A
$$
by weighted least squares, weighting individuals by our estimated IP weights. 

- It is is equivalent to


`$$\frac{ \hat{E}\left[\frac{I(A = a)Y}{f(A\vert L)} \right]}{ \hat{E}\left[\frac{I(A = a)}{f(A\vert L)} \right]} = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^n I(A_i = a)Y_i W_i}{\sum_{i = 1}^n I(A_i = a) W_i}$$`
---

# Hajek Estimator

- Hajek estimator is unbiased for 

`$$\frac{ E\left[\frac{I(A = a)Y}{f(A\vert L)} \right]}{ E\left[\frac{I(A = a)}{f(A\vert L)} \right]}$$`
- Under positivity, 

$$
E\left[\frac{I(A = a)}{f(A\vert L)} \right] = 1
$$

- Guaranteed to be between 0 and 1 for dichotomous outcomes. 

- If positivity does not hold, the Hajek estimator is unbiased for `\(E[Y(a) \vert L \in Q(a)]\)`, where `\(Q(a)\)` is the set of values of `\(l\)` such that `\(P[A = a \vert L = l] &gt; 0\)`. 

- Without positivity, the risk difference estimated by the Hajek estimator does not have a causal interpretation.

# IP Weighted Effect Estimate in NHEFS


```r
lm(wt82_71 ~ qsmk, data = dat, weights  = w)
```

```
## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = wt82_71 ~ qsmk, data = dat, weights = w)
## 
## Coefficients:
## (Intercept)         qsmk  
##       1.780        3.441
```

- We estimate that quitting smoking leads to a 3.4 kg increase in weight gain. 

---
# Estimating the Variance of the Estimate

- The raw variance estimate from weighted least squares does not account for uncertainty in the weights. 

- We need to account for having estimated the IP weights. 

- Options: 

  1. Derive the variance analytically
  2. Non-parametric bootstrapping (more details later)
  3. Robust sandwich variance estimate.
  
- Option 3 is conservative but easier than options 1 and 2. 

- Option 3 can be achieved by fitting with GEE using and independent working correlation matrix or using the `HC0` option in `vcovHC`.

# Stabilized Weights

- Using weights `\(W^{A} = 1/f(A \vert L)\)` we create a pseudo-population in which (heuristically), each person is matched by someone exactly like them who received the opposite treatment. 


- Our pseudo-population is twice as big as our actual sample so the mean of `\(W^A\)` is 2. 

- In the pseudo-population, the frequency of treatment `\(A = 1\)` is 50%. 

- We could have created other pseudo-populations. 

---
# Stabilized Weights

- Our requirements are that, in the pseudo-population, probability of treatment is independent of `\(L\)`. 

- But different people could have different probabilities of treatment. 


- To create stabilized weights, we construct a pseudo-population in which the probability of receiving 
each treatment is the same as the frequency of the treatment in our original sample. 

$$
SW^A = \frac{f(A)}{f(A \vert L)}
$$
---

# Stabilized Weights

- In our data, `\(A\)` is binary, so we can compute `\(f(1)\)` as the proportion of quitters in the data. 


```r
p1 &lt;- mean(dat$qsmk); p1
```

```
## [1] 0.2573436
```

- In the pseudo-population created by the stabilized weights, person in our data set corresponds to  26% of a treated person and 74% of an untreated person. 


```r
dat &lt;- dat %&gt;% mutate(pa = ifelse(dat$qsmk == 0, 1-p1,  p1),
              sw= pa*w)
summary(dat$sw)
```

```
##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
##  0.3312  0.8665  0.9503  0.9988  1.0793  4.2977
```

- The expected value of `\(SW^A\)` is 1 because the pseudo-population is the same size as
the observed data. 

---

# Estimation Using the Stabilized Weights


```r
msm.sw &lt;- geeglm(wt82_71 ~ qsmk,data = dat,
  weights = sw, id = seqn,corstr = "independence")
beta &lt;- coef(msm.w)
SE &lt;- coef(summary(msm.sw))[, 2]
lcl &lt;- beta - qnorm(0.975) * SE
ucl &lt;- beta + qnorm(0.975) * SE
cbind(beta, lcl, ucl)
```

```
##                 beta      lcl      ucl
## (Intercept) 1.779978 1.339514 2.220442
## qsmk        3.440535 2.410587 4.470484
```

- These are exactly the results we saw with the unstabilized weights. 

---
# Why Use Stabilized Weights

- Differences between stabilized and non-stabilized weights only occur when the model for `\(E[Y \vert A]\)` is not saturated. 


- When the model is not saturated, stabilized weights typically result in greater efficiency. 

---

# Marginal Structural Models

- In the IP weighting strategy we create a population in which `\(A\)` is indepedent of `\(L\)` and then fit the model 
`$$E_{ps}[Y \vert A ] = \theta_0 + \theta_1 A$$`

- If we believe our conditional exchangeability assumption `\(Y(a) \ci A \vert L\)`, then in the pseudo-population, `\(E_{ps}[Y \vert A] = E[Y(a)]\)`. 

- So the parameter `\(\theta_1\)` is interpretable as the causal risk difference. 

--

- We have proposed a model for the average counterfactual: 

`$$E[Y(a)] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 a$$`
--

- This model is *marginal* because we have marginalized (averaged) over the values of all
other covariates. 

- It is structural because it is a model for a counterfactual `\(E[Y(a)]\)` rather than 
a probability distribution `\(E[Y \vert A]\)`.

---
# Modeling Continuous Treatments

- Because out treatment was binary, we could construct a saturated model. 

- For continuous (or highly polytomous) variables, we can't do that and will have to use 
a parametric model instead. 

- In the NHEFS data, let `\(A\)` be the change in smoking intensity ( `\(A = 10\)` indicates that a person increased their smoking by 10 cigarettes).

- We will limit to only those who smoked 25 or fewer cigarettes per day at baseline ( `\(N = 1,162\)` )

- We can propose a model for our *dose-response curve*

$$
E[Y(a)] = \beta_0  + \beta_1 a + \beta_2 a^2
$$

---
# Estimating Weights for the Continuous Treatment

- To use stabilized weights, we need to estimate `\(f(A \vert L)\)` and `\(f(A)\)`. 

- Both of these are PDFs which are hard to estimate!

- We will assume that both `\(f(A \vert L)\)` and `\(f(A)\)` are normal with constant variance across participants.
  
- We will estimate the mean of `\(f(A \vert L)\)` via linear regression. 

- These assumptions are almost certainly wrong. 

- IP weighted estimates of continuous variables can be very sensitive to choice of weights.

---
# Estimating Weights for the Continuous Treatment

- We fit a linear model for change in smoking intensity including:

  + sex, race, education, exercise, life activity
  + age and age squared 
  + baseline smoking intensity and baseline smoking intensity squared
  + baseline weight and baseline weight squared
  
- The fitted values of this model give the mean of `\(f(A \vert L)\)`.

- We can use the variance of the residuals as an estimate of the variance of `\(f(A \vert L)\)`

- We then compute `\(f(A \vert L)\)` using `dnorm`. 


---
# Estimating Weights for the Continuous Treatment

- To estimate `\(f(A)\)` we use the same procedure, except that the mean of `\(f(A)\)` is is just the sample proportion of treated or untreated participants. 

- For comparison, we compute both the standardized weights and the non-standardized weights



```r
summary(dat.s$sw_cont)
```

```
##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
##  0.1938  0.8872  0.9710  0.9968  1.0545  5.1023
```

```r
summary(dat.s$w_cont)
```

```
##     Min.  1st Qu.   Median     Mean  3rd Qu.     Max. 
##     25.4     26.4     30.0   1078.1     47.5 428611.4
```

- The non-standardized weights are much more variable!
---
# Fitting the Continuous Treatment Model

- We then fit the marginal structural model $$ E[Y(a)] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 a + \beta_2 a^2$$ using exactly the same strategy we used before.

# Issues with the Continuous Treatment Model

- We had to make strong assumptions about the distribution of `\(A \vert L\)`. 

- There are structural positivity issues -- it is not possible for everyone to reduce their smoking by 80 cigarettes per day. 

---
# Effect Modification in Marginal Structural Models

- We might be interested in estimating the causal effect within strata of `\(V\)`. 

- We can propose a marginal structural model that includes `\(V\)`

$$
E[Y(a) \vert V] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 a + \beta_2 a V + \beta_3 V
$$

- If `\(V\)` and `\(A\)` are both dichotomous, this model is saturated. 

- It is not really fully marginal any more, but we still call it a marginal structural model. 

---
# Interpreting Parameters in the Effect Modification Model

- Suppose that `\(V\)` is sex (0: Male, 1: Female) and `\(A\)` is quitting/not quitting. 

$$
E[Y(a) \vert V] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 a + \beta_2 a V + \beta_3 V
$$

- `\(\beta_1\)` is the causal effect of quitting for men. 

- `\(\beta_1+ \beta_2\)` is the causal effect of quitting for women. 

- What is `\(\beta_3\)`?

--

- `\(\beta_3\)` is not a causal parameter because we haven't made any exchangeability assumptions about `\(V\)`. 

- `\(\beta_3\)` is the difference between `\(E[Y(0)]\)` in females and `\(E[Y(0)]\)` in males but is not the causal effect of sex. 

---
# Stablilized Weights for the EM Model


- We have two choices for stabilized weights

$$
\frac{f(A)}{f(A \vert L)} \qquad \text{or} \qquad  \frac{f(A\vert V)}{f(A \vert L)}
$$

- Which will be more efficient?

--

- Conditioning on `\(V\)` in the numerator will make the numerator closer to the denominator. 

- The second choice of weights will be less variable. 

- So the second choice of weights is more efficient. 

---
# Stablilized Weights for the EM Model

- We need to compute `\(f(A \vert V)\)` in our data. 

- We can just use the stratified means. 


```r
fav_fit &lt;- lm(qsmk ~ sex, data = dat)
dat$pav &lt;- ifelse(dat$qsmk == 0,
                  1-predict(fav_fit, type = "response"), 
                  predict(fav_fit, type = "response"))
dat &lt;- mutate(dat, sw_em = pav*w)
summary(dat$sw_em)
```

```
##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
##  0.2930  0.8751  0.9554  0.9989  1.0803  3.8011
```

---
# Fitting the Effect Modification Model


```r
msm.emm &lt;- geeglm(
  wt82_71 ~ qsmk*sex, data = dat, weights = sw_em, id = seqn,
  corstr = "independence")
beta &lt;- coef(msm.emm)
SE &lt;- coef(summary(msm.emm))[, 2]
lcl &lt;- beta - qnorm(0.975) * SE
ucl &lt;- beta + qnorm(0.975) * SE
cbind(beta, lcl, ucl)
```

```
##                     beta        lcl       ucl
## (Intercept)  1.784446876  1.1771686 2.3917252
## qsmk         3.521977634  2.2341453 4.8098100
## sex         -0.008724784 -0.8883884 0.8709389
## qsmk:sex    -0.159478525 -2.2097583 1.8908013
```

- We have no strong evidence of effect modificaiton by sex. 

---

# Unweighted Regression vs IP Weighting 

- What if we had conditioned on every variable in `\(L\)`? 

- The stabilized weights would be 1, so we would just be running a regular 
regression. 

- If we believe in the model for `\(E[Y(a) \vert L]\)`, then the regression coefficient
is interpretable as a (conditional) causal parameter. 

- Using the marginal model with IP weighting, we need to believe that our estimates of `\(f(A \vert L)\)` are accurate. 

- In some cases, solving a prediction problem is easier than guessing the correct structural model for all confounders.

---

# Censoring and Missing Data With IP Weights

- In our analysis, we have removed 63 individuals who filled in the survey in 1982 but 
who have a missing value for weight. 


&lt;table&gt;
 &lt;thead&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:right;"&gt; Quit Smoking &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:right;"&gt; Number Missing &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:right;"&gt; Percent Missing &lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 0 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 38 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 3.2 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 1 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 25 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 5.8 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

- We have more missing data for people who quit smoking than people who did not, so we could have selection bias. 


---

# Weights for Censoring

- We learned in L4 that, to correct for selection bias, we need to find a set of variables `\(L_c\)` such that `\(Y(C = 0) \ci C \vert L_c\)`. 

- We then need to estimate `\(W^C = 1/P[C = 0 \vert A, L_c]\)`, or the stabilized version `$$SW^C = \frac{P[C = 0 \vert A]}{P[C = 0 \vert A, L_c]}$$`

- We will use the same set of variables, we used to compute weights for confounding. 

- The total weights will be `\(SW^C \cdot SW^A\)`


---

# Weights for Censoring

- We will estimate `\(f(C=0 \vert A, L)\)` using a logistic model adjusting for
  + the exposure
  + sex, race age, education, exercise, life activity
  + linear and quadratic terms for smoking intensity, duration, and baseline weight. 




- We can estimate `\(f(C = 0 \vert A)\)` using the average within levels of `\(A\)`. 



+ Summarizing `\(SW^C\)`

```r
summary(dat$sw.c)
```

```
##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
##  0.9442  0.9782  0.9858  0.9990  1.0035  1.7180
```

- And the combined weights 


```r
summary(dat$sw.comb)
```

```
##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
##  0.3390  0.8593  0.9442  0.9974  1.0749  4.1829
```

  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

# Standardization

- Recall from previous lectures (and homework) that IP weighting and standardization 
were equivalent when we could be fully non-parametric. 

- Our standardization formula is 

$$
E[Y(a)] = \sum_l P[Y \vert A = a, L = l]P[L = l]
$$
- In our example, `\(L\)` is continuous, so we need to integrate

$$
E[Y(a)] = \int_l P[Y \vert A = a, L = l]f(l) dl
$$

---

# Outcome Modeling

- In the standardization formula, we need to estimate `\(P[Y \vert A = a, L = l]\)`.

- To do this we fit a linear regression


```r
fit &lt;-glm( wt82_71 ~ qsmk + sex + race + age + I(age * age) + as.factor(education)
    + smokeintensity + I(smokeintensity * smokeintensity) + smokeyrs
    + I(smokeyrs * smokeyrs) + as.factor(exercise) + as.factor(active)
    + wt71 + I(wt71 * wt71) + qsmk * smokeintensity,
    data = dat.u)
summary(fit)$coefficients %&gt;% head()
```

```

# Outcome Modeling

- This first step of fitting the outcome model is just fitting a regular linear regression. 

- If we believe the outcome model is correct and includes all confounders, we can use the outcome regression to estimate the ATE. 

- However, the regression we fit included an interaction between `\(A\)` and a covariate, smoking intensity.

  + With no interaction, the coefficient on `\(A\)` would estimate the ATE (if the model were correct).
  + A model with no interaction says that the treatment effect is constant across levels of `\(L\)`. 

- With the interaction, the coefficient on `\(A\)` is only the ATE within strata defined by smoking intensity (the conditional effect). 

- To estimate the (marginal) average treatment effect, we need to average over levels of `\(L\)`. 


---
# Standardizing

- Fortunately, we do not need to compute `\(f(l)\)`.


- Using the double expectation, we can write
$$
 \int_l P[Y \vert A = a, L = l]f(l)dl = E\left[ E\left[Y \vert A = a, L = l \right]\right]
$$
- So we can estimate the standardized mean as

$$
\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n\hat{E}[Y \vert A = a, L_i]
$$
---

# Standardizing

- For each person, we need to compute two values `\(\hat{E}[Y \vert A = 0, L_i]\)` and `\(\hat{E}[Y\vert A = 1, L_i]\)`

- These are predicted values that we can get out of our previous regression. 

- We predict each person's outcome with `\(A = 0\)` and with `\(A = 1\)`. 


```r
dat0 &lt;- dat1 &lt;- dat.u 
dat0$qsmk &lt;- 0
dat1$qsmk &lt;- 1

Y0 &lt;- predict(fit, newdata = dat0, type = "response") %&gt;% mean()
Y1 &lt;- predict(fit, newdata = dat1, type = "response") %&gt;% mean()
cat(round(Y1, digits = 2), "-", round(Y0, digits = 2), "=", round(Y1-Y0, digits = 2))
```

```
## 5.18 - 1.66 = 3.52
```

---
# Censoring

- In our case, we have assumed that our set of confounders are also sufficient to adjust for censoring.

- In the previous step, we predicted weight gain for all subjects, even those who had missing values in the original data. 

- If our outcome model is correct *and* `\(Y(C = 0) \ci C \vert L\)`, then this is sufficient 
to eliminate selection bias.

---

# Estimating the Variance 

- To compute the variance of the estimate, we need to bootstrap. 

- We will repeatedly re-sample our data with replacement. 

- Each time, we recompute the standardized effect we just computed in the observed data. 

- The standard deviation of our bootstrap samples consistently estimates the standard error of our estimate. 

---
# Bootstrapping the Variance 


```r
set.seed(1)
samples &lt;- replicate(n = 500, expr = sample(seq(nrow(dat.u)), size = nrow(dat.u), replace = TRUE))
res &lt;- apply(samples, 2, FUN = function(ix){
  boot_dat &lt;- dat.u[ix,]
  boot_fit &lt;-glm( wt82_71 ~ qsmk + sex + race + age + I(age * age) + as.factor(education)
    + smokeintensity + I(smokeintensity * smokeintensity) + smokeyrs
    + I(smokeyrs * smokeyrs) + as.factor(exercise) + as.factor(active)
    + wt71 + I(wt71 * wt71) + qsmk * smokeintensity, data = boot_dat)
  boot_dat0 &lt;- boot_dat1 &lt;- boot_dat 
  boot_dat0$qsmk &lt;- 0 
  boot_dat1$qsmk &lt;- 1
  bootY0 &lt;- predict(boot_fit, newdata = boot_dat0, type = "response") %&gt;% mean()
  bootY1 &lt;- predict(boot_fit, newdata = boot_dat1, type = "response") %&gt;% mean()
  return(bootY1 - bootY0)
})
se &lt;- sd(res)
ci &lt;- (Y1-Y0) + c(-1, 1)*qnorm(0.975)*se 
cat(Y1-Y0, "(", ci, ")")
```

```
## 3.518574 ( 2.576592 4.460556 )
```



---
# Effect Modification in Standardization

- If we want to estimate the average causal effect stratified by `\(V\)`, we can simply stratify by `\(V\)` before averaging our predicted values. 


```r
dat.u$Y0 &lt;- predict(fit, newdata = dat0, type = "response") 
dat.u$Y1 &lt;- predict(fit, newdata = dat1, type = "response")
dat.u %&gt;% group_by(sex) %&gt;% summarize(Y0 = mean(Y0), Y1 = mean(Y1))
```

```
## # A tibble: 2 × 3
##     sex    Y0    Y1
##   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1     0  1.66  5.30
## 2     1  1.66  5.06
```

---

# g-formula

- The formula we have seen for standardization is called the `\(g\)`-formula (g is for generalized)

$$
E[Y(a)] = \sum_l P[Y \vert A = a, L = l]P[L = l]
$$

- The standardization and IP weighting estimation strategies are both making use of the g-formula. 
  + Standardization is a "plug-in" estimator because we just plug estimates of `\(P[Y \vert A, L]\)` into the formula. 

---

# IP Weighting vs Standardization

- When we are non-parametric, IP weighting and standardization are the same. 

- In parametric models, they rely on different assumptions and so are not the same.

- In the IP weighted analysis, we need to trust our model for `\(f(A \vert L)\)`.

- In the standardized analysis, we need to trust our model for `\(E[Y \vert A, L]\)`. 

- In either case, if our our parametric models are wrong, our predictions will be biased and so our estimators will be biased. 

- The amount of bias depends on how bad our predictions are. 

- We can compute both estimates and compare. 

---

# Doubly Robust Estimators

- In doubly robust models, we need a model for both exposure and outcome, but we only need to get one model right. 

- One simple variation: 

  + Estimate IP weights `\(W^A\)` using the exposure model. 
  + Create a new covariate, `\(R\)`, equal to `\(W^A\)` if `\(A = 1\)` and `\(-W^A\)` if `\(A = 0\)`. 
  + Fit an outcome model including the exposure, the confounders, *and* R.
  + Use the predicted values to estimate the standardized mean. 
  
- The standardized mean is now consistent for the causal effect if either model was correct. 

- Even when both estimates are wrong, the bias of the doubly robust estimator is smaller than the bias of the either the IP weighted or standardized estimator. 

- More on DR estimators coming up.
