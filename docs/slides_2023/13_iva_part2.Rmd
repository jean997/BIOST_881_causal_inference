# 1. Structural Equation Motivation for IVW


---
## Structural Equation Model Approach

- Consider the set of linear structural models:

$$A_i(z)  = \beta_{A0} + \beta_{AZ} z + \epsilon_{A,i} \\\
Y_i(a)  = \beta_{Y0} + \gamma a + \epsilon_{Y,i}$$

- $\gamma$ is the causal effect we want to identify. 

- In this model there is both the effect of $Z$ on $A$ and the effect of $A$ on $Y$ are homogeneous (the same for everyone).

- $\epsilon_{A,i}$ and $\epsilon_{Y,i}$ are mean zero deviations, which may depend on other variables.

- If there is confounding between $A$ and $Y$, then $\epsilon_A$ and $\epsilon_Y$ are correlated.

- Using consistency, we can substitute $A_i$ for $A_i(z)$ and $Z_i$ for $z$ in both equations.

---
## IV Assumptions Impose Constraints

$$A_i  = \beta_{A0} + \beta_{AZ} Z_i + \epsilon_{A,i} \\\
Y_i  = \beta_{Y0} + \gamma A_i + \epsilon_{Y,i}$$



- The relevance assumption means that $\beta_{AZ} \neq 0$. 



- The exclusion restriction requires that $Y$ is independent of $Z$ given $A$.  This is satisfied by conditions:
    - $Z_i$ is not in the second equation and 
    - $Cov(Z, \epsilon_{Y}) = 0$
    


- Exchangeability requires that there is no confounding between $Z$ and $Y$. 
    - This is also satisfied by $Cov(Z, \epsilon_{Y}) = 0$ 


- We need an additional condition to identify $\gamma$:  $Cov(Z_i, \epsilon_{A, i}) = 0$.
  + This is equivalent to assuming that the true association between $Z$ and $A$ is linear.  
   
---
## Structural Equation Model Approach

Starting with our system of structural equations:
$$A_i  = \beta_{A0} + \beta_{AZ} Z_i + \epsilon_{A,i} \\\
Y_i  = \beta_{Y0} + \gamma A_i + \epsilon_{Y,i}$$

Plug the first equation into the second. 
$$Y_i  = \beta_{Y0} + \gamma \left(\beta_{A0} + \beta_{AZ} Z_i + \epsilon_{A,i} \right) + \epsilon_{Y,i}\\\
 = \beta_{Y0}^\prime + \gamma \beta_{AZ} Z_i + \epsilon_{Y,i}^\prime$$

---
## Structural Equation Model Approach

$$A_i  = \beta_{A0} + \beta_{AZ} Z_i + \epsilon_{A,i} \\\
Y_i  = \beta_{Y0}^\prime + \gamma \beta_{AZ} Z_i + \epsilon_{Y,i}^\prime$$


This result suggests two estimation strategies: 

--

1. Two stage least squares:

  - Regress $Z$ on $A$ to obtain $\hat{\beta}_{AZ}$. 
  - Regress $Y$ on $\hat{\beta}_{AZ}Z$ to estimate $\gamma$. 

--

2. Ratio estimator: 

  - Regress $A$ on $Z$ to obtain $\hat{\beta}_{AZ}$.
  - Regress $Y$ on $Z$ to obtain $\hat{\beta}_{YZ}$, an estimate of $\gamma\beta_{AZ}$. 
  - Estimate $\gamma$ by $\hat{\beta}_{YZ}/\hat{\beta}_{AZ}$
  
- We will show that these estimates are identical, and for binary $Z$ and $A$, equal to the version of $\beta_{IV}$ we have already seen.
  

---
## Two Stage Least Squares

- Suppose we have $N$ observations of $(Z, A, Y)$. 

- Let $\mathbf{Z}$, $\mathbf{A}$, and $\mathbf{Y}$ be $N\times 1$ vectors. 

- For simplicity, assume that $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{Y}$ are centered (mean 0). 

- Then in the first stage we obtain 
$$\hat{\beta}_{AZ} = (\mathbf{Z}^\top \mathbf{Z})^{-1}\mathbf{Z}^\top\mathbf{A}$$

- In the second stage we regress $\hat{\beta}_{AZ}\mathbf{Z}$ on $Y$. 

$$\hat{\gamma} = \hat{\beta}_{2SLS} =  (\hat{\beta}_{AZ}^2\mathbf{Z}^\top \mathbf{Z})^{-1}\hat{\beta}_{AZ}\mathbf{Z}^\top\mathbf{Y}\\\
\frac{(\mathbf{Z}^\top \mathbf{Z})^{-1}\mathbf{Z}^\top\mathbf{Y}}{\hat{\beta}_{AZ}}
= \frac{\hat{\beta}_{YZ}}{\hat{\beta}_{AZ}}$$



---
## Two Stage Least Squares

- We can see easily that the 2SLS estimator is equal to the ratio estimator. 

- If $Z$ is binary then the OLS estimate of $\hat{\beta}_{AZ}$ is $E[A \vert Z =1]-E[A \vert Z = 0]$ and $\hat{\beta}_{YZ}$ is $E[Y \vert Z = 1] - E[Y \vert Z = 0]$. 

- So $\hat{\beta}_{IV}$ introduced previous is a special case of the ratio estimator. 

---
## Two Sample IV


- Both the 2SLS framework and the ratio estimator framework suggest that we don't need to measure $Z$, $A$ and $Y$ in the same sample. 

- We could instead have two samples, 
  + Sample 1: data for $Z$ and $A$ and 
  + Sample 2: data for $Z$ and $Y$. 

- In 2SLS, we conduct the first stage regression of $A$ on $Z$ in Sample 1. 

- We then use $\hat{\beta}_{AZ}$ to compute $\hat{\beta}_{AZ}Z$ in Sample 2. We then regress $Y$ on this new variable. 
  + $\hat{\beta}_{AZ}Z$ is like an imputed unconfounded version of $A$.
  
- Using the ratio framework, we use Sample 1 to estimate $\hat{\beta}_{AZ}$ and $\hat{\beta}_{YZ}$ and then compute the ratio. 

- These two strategies give identical results. 

---
## Two Sample IV

- Being able to estimate the effect of $A$ on $Y$ without observing $A$ and $Y$ in the same data set is extremely powerful. 

- It makes it possible to address causal questions that would be otherwise impossible to study. 

Examples:

- $A$ and $Y$ might occur very far apart in time making it impractical to measure them in the same units. 
  + E.g Do exposures during pregnancy increase risks of late in life diseases. 
  
- One of $A$ or $Y$ might be challenging to measure while the other is easy. We can have a larger sample size for one stage than the other.
  
- Data have already been collected for either $Z$ and $A$ or $Z$ and $Y$ in a sample that cannot be recontacted. 



```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
n <- 1000
set.seed(1)
Z <- rbinom(n = n, size =1, prob = 0.5)
U <- rbinom(n = n, size = 1, prob = 0.5)
A <- rbinom(n =n, size = 1, prob = 0.2 + 0.5*Z-0.3*U)
Y <- 2*A + rnorm(n = n)
df <- data.frame(Z = Z, U = U, A = A, Y = Y)
S1 <- df[1:500,]
#S2 <- df[501:1000,]
S2 <- df[1:500,]

#2SLS
f1 <- lm(A ~ Z, data = S1)
S2 <- S2 %>% mutate(Ahat = f1$coefficients[2]*Z)
f2 <- lm(Y ~ Ahat, data = S2)
bhat2 <- f2$coefficients[2]
# Ratio
f2z <- lm(Y ~ Z, data = S2)
bhatR <- f2z$coefficients[2]/f1$coefficients[2]

```

## Adjusting for $Z-Y$ Confounding

- Our instrument does not have to perfectly satisfy the exchangeability condition, as long as we have measured any variables confounding $Z$ and $A$. 

- Hernan and Robins suggest that g-methods can be used to estimate the causal effect of $Z$ on $A$ accounting for confounders. 

- Probably the most common strategy is to simply add confounders to the regression of $A$ on $Z$. 

- In the education example, age is a potential confounder between quarter of birth and wages. 
  + Men born in the first quarter are older than their peers who started school the same year. 
  + Age is also associated with earnings. 
  + Angrist and Kruger adjust for age and age squared in the first stage of the 2SLS regression. 

---
# 2. Distribution of Single IV Estimator

---
## Distribution of the IV Estimator

- The standard IV estimator for a single IV is a ratio of random variables. 
$$\hat{\gamma} = \hat{\beta}_{IV} = \frac{\hat{\beta}_{YZ}}{\hat{\beta}_{AZ}}$$

- If $\hat{\beta}_{YZ}$ and $\hat{\beta}_{AZ}$ are estimated in different samples then 
the numerator and denominator are independent. Otherwise, they are dependent. 

- Inconveniently, none of the moments of $\hat{\beta}_{IV}$ exist and it is not normally distributed. 
  + This occurs because there is a finite chance that $\hat{\beta}_{AZ}$ is close to zero. 
  
- However, for instruments with large effects on $A$, the portion of the distribution of $\hat{\beta}_{AZ}$ close to zero is very small and a normal approximation to $\hat{\beta}_{IV}$ works reasonably well. 

---
## Distribution of the IV Estimator

- Write $\hat{\beta}_{AZ} = \mu + \sigma_{AZ} T_A$ where $T_A$ has mean 0 and variance 1, and $\sigma^2_{AZ} = Var(\hat{\beta}_{AZ})$.

- If all of our IV assumptions hold the $\hat{\beta}_{YZ} = \gamma \mu + \sigma_{YZ} T_y$, with  $\sigma^2_{YZ} = Var(\hat{\beta}_{YZ})$.

- This means that,

$$\hat{\beta}_{IV} = \frac{\gamma \mu + \sigma_{YZ} T_Y}{\mu + \sigma_{AZ} T_A} = \gamma \frac{1}{1 + \sigma_{AZ} T_A/\mu} + \frac{\sigma_{YZ} T_Y}{\mu + \sigma_{AZ} T_A}$$
---
## Distribution of the IV Estimator


$$\hat{\beta}_{IV} = \frac{\gamma \mu + \sigma_{YZ} T_Y}{\mu + \sigma_{AZ} T_A} = \gamma \frac{1}{1 + \sigma_{AZ} T_A/\mu} + \frac{\sigma_{YZ} T_Y}{\mu + \sigma_{AZ} T_A}$$

- If $T_{YZ}$ and $T_{AZ}$ are independent, then the expectation of the last term is 0. This occurs in two sample IVA.

- If $T_A$ is normally distributed, then $E[1/(1 + \sigma_{AZ} T_A/\mu)]$ does not have a defined expectation. 

- However, we can see that if $\mu/\sigma_{AZ}$ is large, then $\frac{1}{1 + \sigma_{AZ} T_A/\mu} \approx 1$. 

- If we consider the behavior of $\hat{\beta}_{IV}$ asymptotically as the sample size used to estimate $\hat{\beta}_{ZX}$ increases, $\hat{\beta}_{IV} \to 1$. 

---
## Distribution of the IV Estimator

- We can get estimates of the mean and variance of $\hat{\beta}_{IV}$ from a first order Taylor expansion around $\gamma$.

- Recall that $\hat{\beta}_{IV}$ does not actually have either first or second moments!


- Define $f(\hat{\beta}_{YZ}, \hat{\beta}_{AZ}) = \hat{\beta}_{YZ}/\hat{\beta}_{AZ} = \hat{\beta}_{IV}$. Then for any two-dimensional point $\boldsymbol{\theta}$, 

$$f(\hat{\beta}_{YZ}, \hat{\beta}_{AZ}) = f(\boldsymbol{\theta}) + \nabla f(\boldsymbol{\theta})^\top \begin{pmatrix} \hat{\beta}_{YZ} - \theta_1 \\ \hat{\beta}_{AZ} - \theta_2 \end{pmatrix} + \text{Rem}$$
---
## Distribution of the IV Estimator

- If we plug in $\boldsymbol{\theta} = (E[\hat{\beta}_{YZ}], E[\hat{\beta}_{AZ}]) = (\gamma \mu , \mu)$ we obtain 

$$
\begin{split}
E[f(\hat{\beta}_{YZ}, \hat{\beta}_{AZ})] \approx & \gamma\\
Var(f(\hat{\beta}_{YZ}, \hat{\beta}_{AZ})) \approx &  \gamma^2 \left(\frac{\sigma^2_{AZ}}{ \mu^2} + \frac{\sigma^2_{YZ}}{\gamma^2 \mu^2} - 2 \frac{Cov(\hat{\beta}_{YZ}, \hat{\beta}_{AZ})}{\gamma \mu ^2} \right) \\ 
\approx & \hat{\gamma}^2 \left(\frac{\hat{\sigma}^2_{AZ}}{ \hat{\beta}_{AZ}^2} + \frac{\hat{\sigma}^2_{YZ}}{\hat{\beta}_{YZ}^2} - 2 \frac{Cov(\hat{\beta}_{YZ}, \hat{\beta}_{AZ})}{\hat{\beta}_{AZ}\hat{\beta}_{YZ}} \right)
\end{split}
$$

- In the last step we replace all unknowns with estimates. 

---
## Distribution of the IV Estimator

- To see how good the normal approximation is, we simulate some data. 

- Simulate $\hat{\beta}_{YZ} \sim N(\gamma \mu_x, 1)$ and $\hat{\beta}_{AZ} \sim N(\mu_x, 1)$, independent. 

- Calculate $(\hat{\beta}_{IV} - \gamma)/\sqrt{\hat{V}}$ using the formula from the previous slide to estimate the variance of $\hat{\beta}_{IV}$ 

- Compare these values to a standard normal distribution. 

- We consider values of $\gamma = 0$ or $\gamma = 1$ and $\mu = 1, 2, 5, 10$.

  facet_wrap(~g + m, nrow = 2)  


```

---
## Distribution of the IV Estimator

- The approximation is better when $\mu$ is larger. 

- When $\mu$ is small and $\gamma \neq 0$, $\hat{\beta}_{IV}- \gamma$ is, on average, lower than expected under the normal approximation. We are underestimating the causal effect. 

- This is called **weak instrument bias** because it occurs when the effect of the instrument on the exposure is small compared to the estimation error of $\hat{\beta}_{AZ}$.

---
# 3. Multiple IV Estimators

---
## Multiple Instruments

- Both the 2SLS estimation strategy and the ratio strategy extend to multiple instruments. 

- Let $\mathbf{Z}_i$ be a $k$-vector of instruments.

- For 2SLS, we extend our set of linear models.

$$A_i  = \beta_{A0} + \boldsymbol{\beta}_{AZ}^\top \mathbf{Z}_i + \epsilon_{A,i} \\\
Y_i  = \beta_{Y0} + \gamma A_i + \epsilon_{Y,i}$$

- In the first stage, we estimate $\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{AZ}$. 

- In the second stage regress $Y$ on $\hat{A} = \hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{AZ}^\top Z$. 

- Angrist and Kruger (1991) also examine the problem using quarter of birth interacted with year-of-birth. 
  + This gives multiple instruments could affect total years of education differently. 


---
## Inverse Variance Weighted Regression

- The extension of the ratio estimator to multiple instruments is called **inverse variance weighted regression** or IVW regression.

- For each instrument, we can construct a ratio estimate

$$\hat{\beta}_{IV,1}  = \frac{\hat{\beta}_{YZ_1}}{\hat\beta_{AZ_1}}, \dots, \hat{\beta}_{IV,K}  = \frac{\hat{\beta}_{YZ_K}}{\hat\beta_{AZ_K}}$$
- We then construct an overall estimate as a weighted average $$\hat{\beta}_{IVW} = \frac{\sum_{k=1}^K w_k \hat{\beta}_{IV,k}}{\sum_{k =1}^K w_k}$$ where $w_k$ is the inverse of the (approximate) variance of $\hat{\beta}_{IV,k}$.

- $\hat{\beta}_{IVW}$ is asymptotically equivalent (but not numerically identical) to the  2SLS estimate.


---
## Inverse Variance Weighted Regression

- IVW regression is usually used in the case when only the estimates $\hat{\beta}_{YZ_k}$ and $\hat{\beta}_{AZ_k}$ are available but the individual level data is not. 

- This is the case in Mendelian randomization which is coming up in the later half of this lecture. 

- If $\hat{\beta}_{YZ_k}$ and $\hat{\beta}_{AZ_k}$ are obtained from marginal regressions of $Y$ on each instrument separately and $A$ on each instrument separately, then our instruments need to be marginally approximately indpendent. 

- If we use dependent instruments, we will under-estimate the variance of $\hat{\beta}_{IVW}$. 


---
## IVW Regression


- For IVW regression, we need to choose the weights $w_j$. 

- The most common approach is to use

$$w_k = \frac{\sigma_{Y,Z_k}^2}{\hat{\beta}_{A,Z_k}^2} \approx Var(\hat{\beta}_{IV,k})$$  

- This is the estimate of $Var(\hat{\beta}_{IV,k})$ we would get using our previous formula but assuming that $\gamma = 0$.


- Plugging in these weights gives us

$$\hat{\beta}_{IVW} =   \frac{\sum_{k=1}^K \hat{\beta}_{YZ_k}\hat{\beta}_{AZ_k}\sigma^{-2}_{YZk}}{\sum_{k=1}^K \hat{\beta}_{AZ_k}\sigma^{-2}_{YZ_k}}$$


---

## IVW as Regression of Summary Statistics

- The estimator $$\hat{\beta}_{IVW} = \sum_{k=1}^K   \frac{\hat{\beta}_{YZ_k}\hat{\beta}_{A,Z_k}\sigma^{-2}_{Y,Zk}}{\hat{\beta}_{A,Z_k}\sigma^{-2}_{Y,Zk}}$$
is exactly the estimate we would get from regressing  $(\hat{\beta}_{Y,Z_1}, \dots, \hat{\beta}_{Y, Z_K})$ on $(\hat{\beta}_{A,Z_1}, \dots, \hat{\beta}_{A, Z_K})$ with no intercept.

- This makes sense: our linear model implies that 

$$E[\hat{\beta}_{A, Z_k}] = \beta_{A, Z_k} \qquad\text{and}\qquad
E[\hat{\beta}_{Y, Z_k}] = \gamma\beta_{A,Z_k}$$

- Based on these equations, we might estimate $\gamma$ by substituting $\hat{\beta}_{A, Z_k}$ for $\beta_{A, Z_k}$ in the second equation and fitting a regression.

## Expectation of IVW Estimator

- With $K$ IVs, the moments of the 2SLS and IVW estimators exist up $K-1$. 

- Zhao et al (2019) (and others) calculate an approximation of $E\left[\hat{\beta}_{IVW}\right]$ for independent samples. 

- For simplicity, assume that $\sigma^2_{AZ_k} = \sigma^2_{A}$ and $\hat{\sigma}^2_{YZ_k} = \sigma^2_{Y}$ are constant over instruments.

- Write $\hat{\beta}_{YZ_k} = \gamma \mu_k + \epsilon_{Y,k}$ and $\hat{\beta}_{AZ_k} = \mu_k + \epsilon_{A,k}$.

- With independent samples, $\epsilon_{Y,k}$ and $\epsilon_{A,k}$ are independent.


---
## Expectation of IVW Estimator

$$
\begin{split}
E[\hat{\beta}_{IVW}] =& E\left[\frac{\sum_{k=1}^K \hat{\beta}_{Y,Z_k}\hat{\beta}_{A,Z_k}\sigma^{-2}_{Y,Z_k}}{\sum_{k=1}^K \hat{\beta}_{A,Z_k}\sigma^{-2}_{Y,Zk}}\right]\\
=& E\left[\frac{\sum_{k=1}^K \hat{\beta}_{YZ_k}\hat{\beta}_{A,Z_k}}{\sum_{k=1}^K \hat{\beta}_{A,Z_k}}\right] \approx \frac{E\left[\sum_{k=1}^K \hat{\beta}_{YZ_k}\hat{\beta}_{A,Z_k}\right]}{E\left[\sum_{k=1}^K \hat{\beta}_{A,Z_k}\right]}\\
\approx &\frac{\gamma \sum_{k = 1}^K \mu_k^2}{\sum_{k = 1}^K \mu_k^2 + \sum_{k = 1}^K E[\epsilon_{A,k}^2]} = \frac{\gamma}{1 + (p\sigma^2_{A})/\sum_{k = 1}^K \mu_k^2}\\
=& \frac{\gamma}{1 + 1/\kappa}&
\end{split}
$$

where $\kappa = \frac{1}{p}\sum_{k = 1}^K \frac{\mu_k^2}{\sigma^2_{AZ_k}}$ represents the average instrument strength. 
---
## Expectation of IVW Estimator

- Solving the expression from the previous slide, we find that 

$$E[\hat{\beta}_{IVW} - \gamma] \approx \frac{-\gamma}{\kappa}$$
- $\kappa = \frac{1}{K} \sum_{k = 1}^K \frac{E[\hat{\beta}_{AZ_k}]^2}{\sigma^2_{A,k}}$ represents average instrument strength. This can be estimated as the average chi-squared statistic minus 1.

- Weak instrument bias is pushing the estimate closer to zero. 

- This is the same pattern we saw in the single instrument case. 


---
## Expectation of IVW Estimator

- When there is sample overlap, $\epsilon_{A,k}$ and $\epsilon_{Z_k}$ are not independent and there is an additional term in the expression for the expected bias.

- In the numerator of the expression for $E[\hat{\beta}_{IVW}]$ we have
$$E\left[\sum_{k=1}^K \hat{\beta}_{YZ_k}\hat{\beta}_{A,Z_k}\right] = \gamma \sum_{k = 1}^K \mu_k^2 + Cov(\epsilon_{A,k},\epsilon_{Z_k})$$
- Rearranging terms and combining with the previous expression we have

$$E[\hat{\beta}_{IVW} - \gamma] \approx \frac{-\gamma + \rho c}{\kappa}$$
- Where $\rho = Cor(\epsilon_{A,k},\epsilon_{Z_k})$ and $c = \sigma_{Y}/\sigma_{A}$.

---
## Bias of the OLS Estimate


- Let $\rho_{pop}$ be the population correlation of $A$ and $Y$. 

- The expectation of the OLS estimate regressing $A$ on $Y$ is 

$$
\begin{split}
&E\left[ \hat{\beta}_{OLS} \right] =  \frac{Cov(A, Y)}{Var(A)} = \rho_{pop}\sqrt{\frac{Var(Y)}{Var(A)}} \equiv \rho_{pop} c_{pop}\\
&E\left[ \hat{\beta}_{OLS} -\gamma \right] = \rho_{pop}c_{pop} - \gamma
\end{split}
$$ where $Var(Y)$ is the residual variance of $Y$. 

---
## Bias of the IVW Estimator

- If each instrument explains a small amount of the variance of $A$ and there is complete sample overlap then $\rho \approx \rho_{pop}$ and $c \approx c_{pop}$.

- So the bias of the IVW estimate is approximately equal to the bias of the OLS estimate divided by $\kappa$. 

-  Weak instrument bias is in the direction of the unadjusted (confounded) OLS estimate. 

- We have derived these expressions for the IVW estimator but the same results can be found for the 2SLS estimator.

## Weak Instrument Bias


- The table below shows simulation results from Burgess and Thompson (2011). 

- Relative bias is comparing the OLS and the IV estimate.

- We can see that as predicted, relative bias depends on $1/F$ (approximately $1/\kappa$ in our notation).

## Weak Instrument Bias in the Education Example

- Bound, Jaeger, and Baker (1993 and 1995) point out that after adjusting for age, age squared, and year of birth the F-statistic for the quarter of birth IVs is actually quite small. 

- A small amount of confounding between years of education and wages or slight violations of the exclusion restriction, could account for the results observed by Angrist and Kruger.

## Weak Instrument Bias as Regression Dilution

- Recall that the IVW estimator is a regression of $\boldsymbol{\hat{\beta}}_Y$ on $\boldsymbol{\hat{\beta}}_A$.

- However, our equation was $E[\hat{\beta}_{YZ_k}] = \gamma \beta_{AZ_k}$. We substituted the hat value for $\beta_{AZ_k}$.

- Bias arises because $\hat{\beta}_{AZ_k}$ are measured with error. 

- Measurement error in a predictor will attenuate the estimated coefficient. 


---
## Regression Dilution

- Uncertainty in $\hat{\beta}_{AZ}$ leads to regression dilution, causal estimate biased towards the null.

```
</center>

---
## Selection Bias


- If we test our potential instrument and find that our estimated F statistic is small, we will probably reject it as an instrument. 

- This means that on average, our estimate of $\hat{\beta}_{AZ}$ will tend to be too extreme (far from 0). 

- Overestimating the magnitude of $\hat{\beta}_{AZ}$ will lead us to understimate the magnitude of $\gamma$, biasing results towards the null.  

---
## Selection Bias

- This problem is bigger in settings where there are many possible instruments to choose from and selection is required. 
  + In these circumstances, three sample IV is sometimes suggested. 
  + We use one sample with measurements of $Z$ and $A$ to select instruments, and a second sample with measurements of $Z$ and $A$ to estimate $\hat{\beta}_{AZ}$. 
  
- Bias due to winner's curse tends to be small relative to weak instrument bias and is smaller for more stringent significance cutoffs.

---
## Bias in IV Estimates Summary

- Using 2SLS or IVW in a single sample, bias due to weak instruments will be towards the confounded population correlation. 

- In estimates from separate samples, weak instrument bias will bias the estimate towards the null. 

- Selection bias will bias results towards the null but is smaller than weak instrument bias. 

- This is all bias that occurs *when all of the assumptions are satisfied*. 

- Violations of exchangeability or the exclusion restriction introduce correlation between $Z$ and $\epsilon_{Y}$. If this occurs, bias could be in any direction but will most often be similar to the observational bias. 

---
## Pros and Cons of Using Multiple Instruments

Pros: 
- We have seen that our estimators do not have finite moments for single instruments. 
  - This makes it appealing to use multiple instruments whenever possible. 

- Adding instruments will increase the total F statistic, which we have seen will decrease bias. 

Cons:
- The more instruments we include, the more chances we have to vioalte one of the IV assumptions. 
   + Valid inference depends on all instruments being valid. 
   
- In more non-parametric settings, using multiple instruments can make interpretation hard. 


---
## Multiple Instrument Interpretation

- Each of the ratio estimates is an estimate of the complier average causal effect. 

- However, different instruments have different complier groups. 
  - In Angrist and Kruger, all instruments related to quarter of birth so plausibly, the "complier" group associated with each instrument represent similar populations. 

- If we are not willing to accept a model in which the effect is homogeneous, or there are no non-compliers, we are now estimating a weighted average of LATEs applying to different sub-groups. 

- However, if we believe that the sign of the causal effect is the same in all complier groups, we still have a valid test of the strict null and the sign of the estimated effect is meaningful.

# 4. Mendelian Randomization


---
## Mendelian Randomization


- In Mendelian randomization, genetic variants are used as instruments. 
--


+ Genetic variants are fixed at conception. They can't be altered by any confounders that occur after that point. 

  + No arrows int $Z$ from environment. 
  
--

+ Genetic variants can alter traits like height or disease risk by changing proteins, changing protein levels, or regulating expression of other genes. 

  + Relevance can be satisfied

--

+ If we are willing to assume random mating with respect to the instruments at hand, then an individual's genetic variants are perfect randomizations.

  + No associations with confounders

---
## Mendelian Randomization

- MR is incredibly powerful because it can be applied to any pair of traits that has been studied in genetic association studies. 

- Using summary statistic methods, MR can be applied even when individual level data are not available. 

- However, there are major caveats to results obtained using MR.
---
## Estimation Problems in MR


- Weak instruments: Most variants explain only a tiny amount of trait variation. 

  + Additionally, we are often trying to identify instruments in the same data we will use to estimate $\hat{\beta}_{AZ}$. 
  + This can create selection bias. 

--

- Violations of the exclusion restriction. Some variants causally effect multiple traits. 

  - Also, genetic variants are correlated with each other, so one variant may be correlated with separate causal variants for two different traits. 

--

- Confounding from population structure and assortative mating.

  + We generally try to adjust for this in the regression of $A$ on $Z$. 
  
---
## Interpretation Problems in MR

- Complier groups are unknown and hard to define. We generally don't know the mechanism of most variants. 

- We generally assume that everyone is a complier for all instruments. 

- The exposure can be ill-defined.
- We don't know *when* a variant affects a trait so we cannot differentiate short and long term exposure. 
  + We may know that genetic changes altering $A$ increase disease risk $Y,$ but does that mean that if we pharmaceutically alter $A$ later in life we can prevent $Y$?

- Variants may be affecting different components of an overly broad exposure, e.g. very large LDLs vs large LDLs. 
  
  
---
## MR Solutions

- Despite its problems, MR has one big resource -- lots and lots of genetic variants. 

- The exposure trait may have thousands of causal variants, so thousands of potential instruments. 

- One strategy is to assume that most but not all of the instruments are valid. 

- We can then examine the distribution of ratio estimates and reject variants that look very different from the rest. 

- Another option is to use a robust regression rather than OLS for the regression of $\boldsymbol{\hat{\beta}}_Y$ on $\boldsymbol{\hat{\beta}}_A$. 
  + E.g median or mode regression

- There are many many interesting methods trying different variations of this or related strategies.  

---
## Accounting for Violations of the Exclusion Restriction

- In MR, violations of the exclusion restriction (also called pleiotropy) are the biggest concern. 

- A simple extension of the SEM we have been working with allows for some violations. 

$$A_i  = \beta_{A0} + \boldsymbol{\beta}_{AZ}^\top \mathbf{Z}_i + \epsilon_{A,i}$$
$$Y_i  = \beta_{Y0} + \gamma A_i + \boldsymbol{\alpha}^\top Z_i + \epsilon_{Y,i}$$ 

- The presence of the $\boldsymbol{\alpha}^\top Z_i$ term in the second equation is a violation of the exclusion restriction. 

- As written, the parameters in this new model are not identifiable. We have to make some restrictions on $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$. 

---
## Egger Regression

- Our extended model implies that, if $Z_1, \dots, Z_K$ are independent,  
$$E[\hat{\beta}_{YZ,k}] = \alpha_k + \gamma \beta_{AZ,k}$$

- IVW regression, regresses $\hat{\beta}_{YZ}$ on $\hat{\beta}_{AZ}$ with no intercept.

- Egger regression extends this strategy to add an intercept, fitting
$$E[\hat{\beta}_Y] = \alpha_0 + \gamma \hat{\beta}_A$$

- This strategy is valid if, either $\boldsymbol{\alpha} = \alpha_0 \mathbf{1}_{K}$ or $\sum_{k = 1}^K \alpha_k \beta_{AZ,k}  = 0$
  + If we have a large number of instruments and think of $\beta_{AZ,k}$ and $\alpha_k$ as random, we require that $Cov(\beta_{AZ}, \alpha) = 0$. 
  
- This assumption says that effects of instruments not mediated by $A$ are independent of the effects of instruments on $A$. 
  + This is called the Instrument Strength Independent of the Direct Effect (InSIDE) assumption


---
## Violations of InSIDE

- Violations of the InSIDE assumption occur when some instruments affect $A$ *through* a confounder of the exposure and the outcome.

```
</center>

---
## Median Regression 

- An alternative strategy proposed by Bowden et al (2016) is to assume that most instruments are valid. 

- Rather than use the IVW estimator which averages the $K$ ratio estimates, we take the median of the ratio estimates.

<center> 
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="95%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/10_median.png")
```
</center>

---
## Outlier Robust Regression

- There are several variations of this strategy.

- Modal regression: use the mode of the ratio estimates. 

- Outlier detection: use a strategy to identify outliers and discard them. 

- Robust regression: Use an alternative loss function such as Huber loss to fit the regression. 

<center> 
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="45%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/10_mrpresso.png")
```
</center>

---
## Mixture Models

- Finally, another alternative is to assume that there are two or more groups of instruments. 
- Instruments are grouped by their latent mechanistic relationship to $A$. 
- Instruments with the same mechanistic relationship should have similar ratio estimates. 
- We assume that the largest group of instruments are valid.

# 5. Reassessing Assumptions the SEM

---
## Reassessing Assumptions the SEM
$$A_i  = \beta_{A0} + \boldsymbol{\beta}_{AZ}^\top \mathbf{Z}_i + \epsilon_{A,i} \\\
Y_i  = \beta_{Y0} + \gamma A_i + \epsilon_{Y,i}$$

- We started this section with a very strong model that required complete homogeneity and linearity of effects for the $A$ and $Y$ models. 

- It turns out that we can relax this model.


---
## Assumptions for the $A-Z$ Relationship

$$A_i  = \beta_{A0} + \beta_{AZ}^\top \mathbf{Z}_i + \epsilon_{A,i} \\\
Y_i  = \beta_{Y0} + \gamma A_i + \epsilon_{Y,i}$$

- The 2SLS and IVW estimation strategies are valid even if the first equation is not structural.

- $A$ and $Z$ do need to be linearly associated.
  - i.e. $Cov(Z, \epsilon_A)  = 0$




---
## Assumptions for the $A-Y$ Relationship

$$A_i  = \beta_{A0} + \beta_{AZ}^\top \mathbf{Z}_i + \epsilon_{A,i} \\\
Y_i  = \beta_{Y0} + \gamma A_i + \epsilon_{Y,i}$$

- The second equation does need to be structural, however, it is sufficient that

$$E[Y(a)] = \beta_{Y0} + \gamma a$$


- The requirement that $Cov(Z, \epsilon_Y) = 0$ can't be relaxed. 
  + This assumption ensures that the exclusion restriction and exchangeability hold.

---
## Consequences of Non-Linearity

- Non-linearity could occur in either the $A-Z$ relationship or in the $Y(a)-a$ relationship. 

- If the relationship betwen $E[Y \vert Z]$ is non-linear in $Z$, the first stage regression is mis-specified.  
  + We will have a violation of the requirement $Cov(Z, \epsilon_A) = 0$. 
  + A non-linear relationship between $Z$ and $A$ has the same effect as confounding between $Z$ and $A$.
  + Our estimate of $\hat{A}$ will be bad. 
  
- The good news is we have a chance to correct this. 
  + Using model diagnositcs, we can evaluate the linearity assumption. 
  + We could additional terms, like a quadratic term, to the regression. 
  + Or we could use a flexible method like smoothing splines. 
  
---
## Non-Linear Exposure Outcome Relationship

- $E[Y(a)] = g(a)$ is non-linear in $a$, then the 2SLS estimate does not estimate the ATE.

- However, the parameter that we do estimate is not meaningless. 

- If every IV is binary and has equal effect size, $\gamma$, then we estimate the local average causal effect

$$LACE(a) \frac{E[Y(a + \gamma) - Y(a)]}{\gamma}$$

- There are IV extensions that allow us to estimate the non-linear relationship between $Y(a)$ and $a$.
