## Causal Inference with Randomized Trials

- We saw in L1 that randomized trials are the "gold standard" for causal inference for several reasons:

- In a trial, treatment arms and the outcome of interest are explicitly defined before the trial starts. 
  + This ensures that the causal contrast is clear and well defined. 

- Randomization ensures that `\(Y(a) \ci A\)` or `\(Y(A) \ci A \mid L\)` for known covariates `\(L\)`. 

- Clear eligibility requirements make it easy to understand the population and help prevent selection bias.



---
## Target Trial Framework

- The target trial framework is a method for formalizing causal inference with observational data.

- The goal is to identify a target randomized trial that can be emulated using observational data. 

- This framework can help guide analysis of observational data and can force researchers make explicit definitions of causal effects. 

---
## Example from Hernan and Robins (2016)

- Suppose we have a large database of electronic health records. 

- We want to estimate the effect of post-menopausal hormone replacement therapy use on breast cancer risk. 

- Discuss with your partner how you might design a randomized trial to evaluate this question. Consider the following factors:
  + Eligibility criteria
  + How is treatment defined?
  + How is outcome defined?
  + What is the causal contrast of interest?

---
## Emulating the Target Trial

- Our goal is to make analysis choices with the observational data that mimic the target trial. 


- Note that not all trial designs can be emulated with the available observational data. 

- For example, we couldn't emulate a trial that required blinding of participants and doctors. 

- This means that we have to develop the target trial plan in consideration of the observational data. 
- Doing this exercise also helps us identify if the data we have is suitable for causal inference:
  + If we cannot come up with a target trial to emulate, we can conclude that our observational data has fatal limitations that prevent us from estimating causal effects or our causal question is poorly specified.

---
## Eligiability

- Our target trial has eligibility criteria of 
  + Women within 5 years post-menopause between 2005 and 2010, no history of cancer, no hormone therapy in past two years
  
- In order to be included in our analysis, we must known a woman's date of menopause onset. 

- She must have been followed in the healthcare system for at least two years prior to baseline,

- And followed for a long enough time that we are reasonably confident we know her cancer history.
  
- By trying to mimic the trial, we can see that we should not use post-baseline features such as post-baseline contact with the healthcare system to define eligibility.
 
---
## Treatment Assignment

- In the randomized trial, treatment is assigned randomly by investigators. 

- In order to ensure conditional exchangeability in the observational data, we need to identify possible confounders of treatment and outcome. 

- If all confounders are measured and modeled correctly, we can mimic a conditionally randomized trial. 

- Observational data could fall short here.
  + For example, doctors may give different treatment recommendations to women with or without a family history of breast cancer. 
  + Family history may be linked to later cancer risk through genetic factors. 
  + If family history of breast cancer isn't measured, we can't account for this. 
  
- If important confounders are unemasured, we cannot do causal inference!


---
## Treatment Specificity

- Notice that in the target trial, the treatment is defined very specifically. 

- For example, we specified the type of HRT rather than just specifying "any kind of HRT". 

- If we had specified the treatment as "Some kind of HRT of the patient's choosing", we would have potential violation of the no different versions of treatment component of SUTVA. 

- However, this means that some people in the data will have received neither of the two treatments we are considering. 
  + These people are censored from baseline onwards. 
  + If we think there may be effect modification, this will mean that the effect we measure may not generalize to the entire population. 


---
## Treatment Specificity

- There are some kinds of exposures that don't lend themselves to such specific definitions.
  + For example, BMI, race, gender, and birth year
  
- We could define a hypothetical intervention for BMI, such as instantaneous reduction of BMI to 25. 
  + But nobody in our data will have experienced this intervention, so we can't measure it's affect. 

- There is some philosophical debate about whether it makes sense to measure effects of this type of exposure. 
  + We will revisit this at the end of the course. 
  + I recommend not using one of these exposures in your project. 
  
---
## Treatment Specificity

- By forcing ourselves to use a specifically defined intervention, we can help ensure the SUTVA assumption. 

- It also ensures that our causal contrast is well defined. 

---
## Timing

- By considering the target trial, we can see that it is important to know when different events happen relative to each other. 

- In the trial, post-menopausal women are enrolled, assigned a treatment, and then followed for five years. 

- This helps us have a clear definition of the causal contrast and helps us establish that the outcome happens after the treatment. 

---
## Timing

- Data that don't capture timing may not be suitable for causal inference. 

- If our data told us only if a woman had ever used HRT and if she had ever had breast cancer, we wouldn't be able to emulate any randomized trial. 

- This doesn't mean that cross-sectional data is useless:
  + Sometimes survey's ask participants questions that allow us to establish time ordering.
  + Or sometimes treatments are clearly anchored to other events such as pregnancy, disease treatment, age, completion of school, or incarceration. 



---
## When is Baseline?

- In the trial, there is an event, enrollment, that defines the start of the five year period. 

- But in our data, one woman might be eligible over a range of time points. 

- Two solutions: 
  1. Define a single baseline for each person, either the first time they are eligible or a random time. 
  2. Emulate a series of trials that begin at different times. Allow the same person to appear in multiple trials.
  
- The second option gives us more statistical power but is conceptually trickier. 
  + We will talk about this at greater length in the second half of the semester. 
  + Check the related reading, Hernan et al (2008) for more details. 


---
## Adherence 

- Both the target trial and the observational data could have issues of non-adherence.
  - Some individuals may begin one treatment at baseline and then switch treatment later 
  - Or they may be prescribed a medication that they don't take. 

- In the target trial, we could estimate the intent-to-treat effect (ITT) by ignoring non-adherence and keeping individuals in their initial treatment group. 
  + In the observational data this corresponds to comparing initiators and non-initiators.

- We could estimate the per-protocol effect for example, by censoring individuals at the time they become non-adherent and estimating censoring weights. 
  - In the observational data, we may or may not be able to observe adherence. 
  
---
## Censoring

- Post-baseline loss to followup affects trials and observational data analyses similarly. 

- If there is a substantial amount of censoring, we need to account for it using either weighting or standardization accounting for necessary variables (recall L3).

---
## Application to Project

- As you are developing your project, try to conceive of a target trial that you can emulate with the data that you have. 

- If you cannot find a reasonable target trial that you can emulate, you may need to modify your question, find different data, or augment your data with another data source. 

- Possible pitfalls: 
  + Lack of time information
  + Lack of important confounders
  + Vaguely defined exposures
