# 1. Introduction

---

## G-Formula

- The formula we saw previously as the standardization formula is also called the g-formula

$$
E[Y(a)] = \sum_l E[Y \vert A = a, L = l]P[L = l]
$$

- We showed in L1 that an alternate expression of the g-formula is 

$$
E[Y(a)] = E\left[ \frac{I(A = a) Y}{P(A = a \vert L)}\right]
$$

---

## Non-Parametric G-Formula Estimates

- In L1-L5, we always assumed that `\(L\)` and `\(A\)` were discrete and data was abundant. 

- This allows us to estimate the components of these formulas non-parametrically as

$$
`\begin{split}
&amp;\hat{E}[Y \vert A = a, L = l] = \frac{\sum_{i} 1_{A = a, L = l} Y_i}{\sum_i 1_{A = a, L = l}}\\
&amp;\hat{P}[L = l] = \frac{\sum_i 1_{L = l}}{n}
\end{split}`
$$

and

$$
`\begin{split}
\hat{P}[A = a \vert L = l] = \frac{\sum_{i} 1_{A = a, L = l}}{\sum_i 1_{L = l}}
\end{split}`
$$

- We showed in HW1 that if we plug these estimates into their respective formulas, the standardization and IP weighting formulas give exactly the same estimate.

---
## Models

- In most cases, `\(L\)` is multivariate and we don't have enough data to use the non-parametric estimates. 

- In these cases, we will need to substitute parametric estimates. 

- What are some ways you know to estimate `\(E[Y \vert A = a, L = l]\)`?

- What are some ways you know to estimate `\(P[ A = a \vert L = l]\)`?

---

## Models


- Formally, a **model** is a class of probability distributions `\(\mathcal{M} = \lbrace P_\theta : \theta \in \Theta \rbrace\)`. 

- `\(\theta\)` is a (possibly infinite) vector of parameters and `\(\Theta\)` is the parameter space. 

- A model is called **parametric** when `\(\theta\)` is finite dimensional and `\(\mathcal{M}\)` is not the set of all possible probability distributions. 

- If `\(\theta\)` is infinite dimensional, `\(\mathcal{M}\)` may be called **non-parametric** or **semi-parametric**.
  + Semi-parametric models have a finite, structured component, and an infinite component. 
  
- In this  lecture we will talk about parametric models. 

---
## Parametric G-Formula Estimates

- We can use the G-formula to obtain estimates of `\(E[Y(a)]\)` using parametric estimates of the components of the formulas. 

- If we use parametric estimates, we will generally **not** get numerically identical estimates from the two versions of the formula.
  + As a result, the G-formula provides us with two estimation methods with different methods.


- G-computation (also called standardization): Estimate `\(E[Y \vert A, L]\)` and plug into the first version of the g-formula. 

- IP weighting: Estimate `\(P(A =a \vert L)\)`, the **propensity score**, and plug into the second version of the g-formula.

# 2. Inverse Probabilty Weighting 

---
## NHEFS Data

- Cigarette smokers aged 25-74 were recruited around 1971 and given a survey. 

- Ten years later, participants were given a followup survey. 

- We are interested in estimating the effect of quitting smoking on weight change on the additive scale. 


---

## Variables

- Our exposure is binary (whether or not a person quit smoking between the first and second survey).

- The outcome is the change in weight in kg. 


- What other features would you want to know in order to estimate the causal effect?

--

- For now we will assume that the following variables are sufficient: 

+ Sex (0: male, 1: female)
+ Age (in years)
+ Race (0: white, 1: other)
+ Education (5 categories)
+ Intensity of smoking (cigarettes per day)
+ Duration of smoking (years)
+ Physical activity in daily life (3 categories)
+ Recreational exercise (3 categories)
+ Weight (kg)

---
## Limitations

- For now we will focus on individuals with complete data. 
  + There are some people who did not fill in the second survey. 
  + For these people we know covariates but don't know either the exposure or the outcome. 
  + Additionally, there are 63 people who did fill in the second survey but who's weight is unknown. 
  + More on this later. 

- Individuals may have quit at different times. 

  + We could think of `\(A\)` as a time-varying treatment (coming up later). 

---
## Simple Analysis

- The simplest analysis is to simply compare the mean weight change between quitters and non-quitters. 


&lt;table&gt;
 &lt;thead&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:right;"&gt; Quit Smoking &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:right;"&gt; Average Weight Change &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:right;"&gt; N &lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 0 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 1.98 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 1163 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 1 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 4.53 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 403 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

- On average, quitters gained about 5kg over the 10 year period while non-quitters only gained about 2kg. 

- This is the unadjusted association, `\(E[Y \vert A = 1] - E[Y \vert A = 0]\)`.
- We learned previously that this is only an estimate of the causal effect of `\(Y(a) \ci A\)`. 

- Since we don't think that is true in these data, this is probably not a good estimate of the causal effect.

## Estimating Weights

- In our data, `\(L\)` is a vector of nine measurements. 

- We cannot compute `\(P[A = 1 \vert L ]\)` among every (or any) stratum of `\(L\)` because every
participant has their own unique value of `\(L\)`. 

- Instead, we will fit a parametric model!


---

## Weights Estimated by Logistic Regression 

- We will use a logistic regression model to predict `\(P[A \vert L]\)`

- The goal is to get the best possible estimate of the probability of treatment given `\(L\)`, so 
we should fit a flexible model. 

- Once we fit the model, we can estimate the probability of quitting for each person as  `\(\pi_i = P[A = 1 \vert L = L_i]\)`. 
  + These are the probability-scale fitted values from the logistic model. 
  + Recall, `\(\pi_i\)` is the **propensity score**.

- The weight for individual `\(i\)` is `\(\frac{1}{\pi_i}\)` if `\(A_i = 1\)` (the person actually did quit) or `\(\frac{1}{1-\pi_i}\)` if `\(A_i = 0\)` (the person did not quit). 

---

## Weights Estimated by Logistic Regression 


``` r
fit &lt;- glm(qsmk ~ sex + race + age + I(age ^ 2) +
    as.factor(education) + smokeintensity +
    I(smokeintensity ^ 2) + smokeyrs + I(smokeyrs ^ 2) +
    as.factor(exercise) + as.factor(active) + wt71 + I(wt71 ^ 2),
    family = binomial(), data = dat)

dat$w &lt;- ifelse(dat$qsmk == 0, 
                1/(1 - predict(fit, type = "response")), 
                1/(predict(fit, type = "response")))
```


```
##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
##   1.054   1.230   1.373   1.996   1.990  16.700
```


- Why is the mean value close to 2?

---

## Positivity 

- *Structural violations* of positivity occur when it is impossible for people with some 
levels of confounders to receive a particular level of treatment. 

  + If there are structural violations, we cannot use IP weighting or standardization. 
  + We need to restrict our inference to strata of `\(L\)` where positivity holds. 

- *Random violations* of positivity occur when certain combinations of `\(L\)` and `\(A\)` 
are missing from our data by chance. 

  + Using a parametric propensity model, we can smooth over unobserved covariate values. 
  + Using IP weighting with a parametric model, we are implicitly assuming that all violations of positivity are random and not structural. 
  + We still need to be careful about predicting outside the range of the observed data. 


---

## Assessing Positivity in Propensity Scores

- If positivity holds, propensity scores should be bounded away from 0 and 1:
  
  + Scores very close to 0 or very close to 1 suggest that there are some strata of `\(L\)` that have no chance to receive one of the two treatments.
  + We might get scores close to 0 or 1 if there is perfect separation by one or a combination of confounders.
  + Scores close to 0 or 1 suggest there could be structural positivity violations. 

- Propensity scores should have approximately the same range in both groups. 

  + Non-overlapping ranges indicate that there are some regions of confounder space with only cases or only controls in our study. 
  + If we believe the PS model, we can trust the weights and assume this is due to random positivity violations. 
  + In some approaches based on propensity scores, this will cause a problem (matching and subclassification).

---

## Horvitz-Thompson Estimator

- The *Horvitz-Thompson estimator* is one of two options for estimating `\(E[Y(a)]\)` using our 
estimated weights.

- The Horvitz-Thompson estimator just plugs our estimated weights into our previous formula.

$$
\hat{E}[Y(a)] = \hat{E}\left[\frac{I(A = a)Y}{P(A= a\vert L)} \right] = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^n I(A_i = a)Y_i W_i
$$

---

## Hajek Estimator

- The *Hajek estimator* fits the linear model 
$$
E[Y \vert A] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 A
$$
by weighted least squares, weighting individuals by our estimated IP weights. 

- It is is equivalent to


`$$\frac{ \hat{E}\left[\frac{I(A = a)Y}{P(A =a\vert L)} \right]}{ \hat{E}\left[\frac{I(A = a)}{P(A =a\vert L)} \right]} = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^n I(A_i = a)Y_i W_i}{\sum_{i = 1}^n I(A_i = a) W_i}$$`
---

## Hajek Estimator

- THe Hajek estimator is an unbiased estimate of 

`$$\frac{ E\left[\frac{I(A = a)Y}{P(A =a\vert L)} \right]}{ E\left[\frac{I(A = a)}{P(A = a\vert L)} \right]}$$`
- If positivity holds, then  

$$
`\begin{split}
E\left[\frac{I(A = a)}{P(A = a\vert L)} \right] = &amp; E_l \left[ E\left[\frac{I(A = a)}{P(A = a\vert L = l )}  \Big\vert L  \right] \right]\\
 = &amp; E_l \left[ \frac{E[I(A = a) \vert L = l]}{P(A = a\vert L = l)} \right]\\
 = &amp; E_l \left[ \frac{P(A = a \vert L = l)}{P(A = a\vert L = l)}\right] = 1
\end{split}`
$$

- The Hajek estimator is guaranteed to be between 0 and 1 for dichotomous outcomes. The Horvitz-Thompson estimator is not. 


---

## IP Weighted Effect Estimate in NHEFS

- To compute the Hajek estimator, we fit a weighted linear regression:


``` r
f_w_lm &lt;- lm(wt82_71 ~ qsmk, data = dat, weights  = w)
f_w_lm
```

```
## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = wt82_71 ~ qsmk, data = dat, weights = w)
## 
## Coefficients:
## (Intercept)         qsmk  
##       1.780        3.441
```

- We estimate that if nobody had quit smoking, the average weight gain would have been 1.8 kg. 

- If everyone had quit smoking, the average weight gain would have been 5.2 kg.

- The average causal effect of quitting smoking on weight gain is 3.4 kg. 

---
## Estimating the Variance of the Estimate

- The raw variance estimate from weighted least squares does not account for uncertainty in the weights. 

- We need to account for having estimated the IP weights. 

- Options: 

  1. Derive the variance analytically
  2. Bootstrap the variance
  3. Use a robust sandwich variance estimate.
  
- Option 3 is conservative but easier than options 1 and 2. 

- Option 3 can be achieved by fitting with GEE using and independent working correlation matrix or using the `HC0` option in `vcovHC`.

                id = seqn,corstr = "independence")

```

all.equal(v_wlm_robust, vcov(f_w_gee))
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

---

## Marginal Structural Models

- In the IP weighting strategy, we create a population in which `\(A\)` is independent of `\(L\)` and then fit the model 
`$$E_{ps}[Y \vert A ] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 A$$`

- If  `\(Y(a) \ci A \vert L\)` in the sample and `\(A \ci L\)` in the pseudo-population, then `\(Y(a) \ci A\)` in the pseudo-population. 
  + This means that `\(E_{ps}[Y \vert A] = E[Y(a)]\)`. 

- So the parameter `\(\beta_1\)` is interpretable as the causal risk difference. 

--

- Our model for `\(E_{ps}[Y \vert A]\)` is actually a **marginal structural model (MSM)**: 

`$$E[Y(a)] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 a$$`

- This model is *marginal* because it is not conditional on any covariates. 

- It is structural because it is a model for a counterfactual `\(E[Y(a)]\)`.


---
## Modeling Continuous Treatments

- With a binary exposure, there is only one possible marginal structural model.
  + `\(E[Y(a)] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 a\)` is a fully saturated model.

- For continuous (or highly polytomous) exposures, we need to use a parametric model instead. 

- In the NHEFS data, let `\(A\)` be the change in smoking intensity ( `\(A = 10\)` indicates that a person increased their smoking by 10 cigarettes).

- We can propose a model for our *dose-response curve*

$$
E[Y(a)] = \beta_0  + \beta_1 a + \beta_2 a^2
$$
---
## Weights for Continuous Treatment

- To use IP weighting with a continuous treatment, we need to estimate the conditional pdf of `\(A\)`, `\(f(A \vert L)\)`. 

- Estimating a pdf is a notoriously hard problem.

- One solution is to assume that `\(f(A \vert L)\)` is normal with constant variance across participants, but this is a very strong assumption. 

  
- We can then estimate the mean of `\(f(A \vert L)\)` via linear regression and the variance of `\(f(A \vert L)\)` as the empirical residual variance from the linear regression. 

- IP weighted estimates of continuous variables can be very sensitive to these distributional assumptions.



---
## Stabilized Weights

- Using weights `\(W^{A} = 1/f(A \vert L)\)`, we create a pseudo-population in which each person is matched by someone exactly like them who received the opposite treatment. 


- Our pseudo-population is twice as big as our actual sample so the mean of `\(W^A\)` is 2. 

- In the pseudo-population, the frequency of treatment `\(A = 1\)` is 50% for every stratum of `\(L\)`, so in the pseudo-population, `\(A \ci L\)` .
  - This also means that, in the pseudo-population `\(Y(a) \ci A\)` (unconditionally), which is why we can use the weighted mean to estimate `\(E[Y(a)]\)`. 


---
## Stabilized Weights

- We could have created other pseudo-populations in which `\(A\)` is independent of `\(L\)`. 
  
- For example, to create a pseudo-population the same size as our observed data with treatment probability of 0.5, we could multiply all of the weights by 0.5.

- To create a pseudo-population the same size as our observed data with treatment probability of 0.25, we would multiple the weights for people with `\(A = 1\)` by 0.25 and the weights for people with `\(A = 0\)` by 0.75.

- As long as we scale the weights by some quantity that doesn't depend on `\(L\)`, we create a pseudo-population in which `\(A \ci L\)`. 

---
## Stabilized Weights

- If we look at the formula for the Hajek estimator, we can see that multiplying the weights by a factor that only depends on `\(A_i\)` will not change the estimate.

`$$\frac{ \hat{E}\left[\frac{I(A = a)Y}{P(A =a\vert L)} \right]}{ \hat{E}\left[\frac{I(A = a)}{P(A =a\vert L)} \right]} = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^n I(A_i = a)Y_i W_i}{\sum_{i = 1}^n I(A_i = a) W_i}$$`
- This is because the MSM for a binary treatment is saturated.

---
## Stabilized Weights

- For a non-saturated MSM, like we constructed for smoking intensity, multiplying `\(W_i\)` by a constant depending on `\(A_i\)` **will** change the estimate, but *not* the expected value of the estimate.


- As long as we multiply `\(W_i\)` by something that doesn't depend on `\(L\)`, we will get an unbiased estimate of the structural parameters. 

- But different choices of multipliers will result in more or less efficient estimates. 

- It turns out that the most efficient estimate is achieved with **stabilized weights**

$$
SW^A = \frac{f(A)}{f(A \vert L)}
$$

- These weights correspond to a pseudo-population in which the treatment has the same marginal distribution as in our observed data. 

---

## Stabilized Weights

- We saw that for binary `\(A\)`, we don't expect using stabilized weights to change the estimate. Let's confirm this using our data. 

- For our binary treatment example, we can compute `\(f(1)\)` as the proportion of quitters in the data. 


``` r
p1 &lt;- mean(dat$qsmk); p1
```

```
## [1] 0.2573436
```

---

## Stabilized Weights

- Next we compute stabilized weights by multiplying our original weights by `\(P(A = A_i)\)`:


``` r
dat &lt;- dat %&gt;% mutate(pa = ifelse(dat$qsmk == 0, 1-p1,  p1),
              sw= pa*w)
summary(dat$sw)
```

```
##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
##  0.3312  0.8665  0.9503  0.9988  1.0793  4.2977
```

- The expected value of `\(SW^A\)` is 1 because the pseudo-population corresponding to the stabilized weights is the same size as
the observed data. 

---

## Estimation Using the Stabilized Weights

- We can use the stabilized weights in exactly the same way we used the non-stabilized weights.


``` r
f_sw_gee &lt;- geeglm(wt82_71 ~ qsmk,data = dat,
  weights = sw, id = seqn,corstr = "independence")

```

```
##                 beta      lcl      ucl
## (Intercept) 1.779978 1.339514 2.220442
## qsmk        3.440535 2.410587 4.470484
```

- As expected, these are exactly the results we saw with the non-stabilized weights. 


---
## Estimating Weights for the Continuous Treatment

- If we return to the continuous treatment example, to estimate stabilized weights we need to estimate `\(f(A)\)` in addition to `\(f(A \vert L)\)`

- We will assume that `\(f(A)\)` is normal with constnat variance. 

- We can estimate the mean of `\(f(A)\)` as the overall sample mean of `\(A\)`  and the variance as sample variance of `\(A\)`. 

- Again, we are making some very strong distributional assumptions

---
## Estimating Weights for the Continuous Treatment

- To estimate the mean of `\(f(A \vert L)\)`, we fit a linear model for change in smoking intensity including:

  + sex, race, education, exercise, life activity
  + age and age squared 
  + baseline smoking intensity and baseline smoking intensity squared
  + baseline weight and baseline weight squared
  
- We can use the residual variance from this model as an estimate of the variance of `\(f(A \vert L)\)`. 

- Once we have the mean and variance of `\(f(A \vert L)\)` and `\(f(A)\)`, we can estimate
`\(f(A = A_i \vert L = L_i)\)` and `\(f(A = A_i)\)` for individual `\(i\)` using `dnorm`. 


---
## Estimating Weights for the Continuous Treatment

- We will limit to only those who smoked 25 or fewer cigarettes per day at baseline ( `\(N = 1,162\)` )



``` r
dat.s &lt;- filter(dat, smokeintensity &lt;= 25)
## Fit model for E[A | L]
fal_fit&lt;- lm(smkintensity82_71 ~ as.factor(sex) +
    as.factor(race) + age + I(age ^ 2) +
    as.factor(education) + smokeintensity + I(smokeintensity ^ 2) +
    smokeyrs + I(smokeyrs ^ 2) + as.factor(exercise) + as.factor(active) + wt71 +
    I(wt71 ^ 2), data = dat.s)
fal_mean &lt;- predict(fal_fit, type = "response")
## compute f(A = Ai | L = Li) for each individual
fal  &lt;- dnorm(dat.s$smkintensity82_71, fal_mean,
        summary(fal_fit)$sigma)
```

---
## Estimating Weights for the Continuous Treatment

- To estimate `\(f(A)\)` we use the same procedure, except that the mean of `\(E[A]\)` is is just the average change in smoking intensity. 


``` r
## Estimate f(A | L)
fa_fit &lt;- lm(smkintensity82_71 ~ 1, data = dat.s)
fa_mean &lt;- predict(fa_fit, type = "response")
fa &lt;- dnorm(dat.s$smkintensity82_71, fa_mean,
            summary(fa_fit)$sigma)

## compute stabilized and non-stabilized weights
dat.s$sw_cont &lt;- fa / fal
dat.s$w_cont &lt;- 1/fal
```

---
## Estimating Weights of the Continuous Treatment

- Let's compare the distribution of the stabilized and non-stabilized weights:


``` r
summary(dat.s$sw_cont)
```

```
##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
##  0.1938  0.8872  0.9710  0.9968  1.0545  5.1023
```

``` r
summary(dat.s$w_cont)
```

```
##     Min.  1st Qu.   Median     Mean  3rd Qu.     Max. 
##     25.4     26.4     30.0   1078.1     47.5 428611.4
```

- The non-stabilized weights are much more variable!

---
## Fitting the Continuous Treatment Model

- Next, we then fit the marginal structural model $$ E[Y(a)] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 a + \beta_2 a^2$$ using exactly the same strategy we used before.

## Continuous Model Results


&lt;img src="5_modeling1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- Do you have any complaints about this plot?

---
## Issues with the Continuous Treatment Model

- We had to make strong assumptions about the distribution of `\(A \vert L\)`. 

- There are structural positivity issues. 
  - It is not possible for everyone to reduce their smoking by 80 cigarettes per day. In fact, we limited to ony those who smoke less than 25 cigarettes at baseline. 

---
## Effect Modification in Marginal Structural Models

- We might be interested in estimating the causal effect within strata of `\(V\)`. 

- To do this, we can propose a marginal structural model that includes `\(V\)`

$$
E[Y(a) \vert V] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 a + \beta_2 a V + \beta_3 V
$$

- If `\(V\)` and `\(A\)` are both dichotomous, this model is saturated. 

- It is not really fully marginal any more, but we still call it a marginal structural model. 

---
## Interpreting Parameters in the Effect Modification Model

- Suppose that `\(V\)` is sex (0: Male, 1: Female) and `\(A\)` is quitting/not quitting. 

$$
E[Y(a) \vert V] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 a + \beta_2 a V + \beta_3 V
$$

- `\(\beta_1\)` is the causal effect of quitting for men. 

- `\(\beta_1+ \beta_2\)` is the causal effect of quitting for women. 

- What is `\(\beta_3\)`?

--

- `\(\beta_3\)` is not a causal parameter because we haven't made any exchangeability assumptions about `\(V\)`. 

- `\(\beta_3\)` is the difference between `\(E[Y(0)]\)` in females and `\(E[Y(0)]\)` in males but is not the causal effect of sex. 

---
## Stablilized Weights for the EM Model


- We have two choices for stabilized weights

$$
\frac{f(A)}{f(A \vert L)} \qquad \text{or} \qquad  \frac{f(A\vert V)}{f(A \vert L)}
$$

- The second choice is available because we only need our stabilizing factor to not depend on `\(L\)` *within* levels of `\(V\)`. 

- Which choice will be more efficient?

--

- Conditioning on `\(V\)` in the numerator will make the numerator closer to the denominator. 

- The second choice of weights will be less variable, and therefore more efficient. 

---
## Stablilized Weights for the EM Model

- We need to compute `\(f(A \vert V)\)` in our data. 

- We can just use the stratified means. 


``` r
fav_fit &lt;- lm(qsmk ~ sex, data = dat)
dat$pav &lt;- ifelse(dat$qsmk == 0,
                  1-predict(fav_fit, type = "response"), 
                  predict(fav_fit, type = "response"))
dat &lt;- mutate(dat, sw_em = pav*w)
summary(dat$sw_em)
```

```
##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
##  0.2930  0.8751  0.9554  0.9989  1.0803  3.8011
```

---
## Fitting the Effect Modification Model


``` r
msm_em &lt;- geeglm(
  wt82_71 ~ qsmk*sex, data = dat, weights = sw_em, id = seqn,
  corstr = "independence")
beta &lt;- coef(msm_em)
SE &lt;- coef(summary(msm_em))[, 2]
lcl &lt;- beta - qnorm(0.975) * SE
ucl &lt;- beta + qnorm(0.975) * SE
cbind(beta, lcl, ucl)
```

```
##                     beta        lcl       ucl
## (Intercept)  1.784446876  1.1771686 2.3917252
## qsmk         3.521977634  2.2341453 4.8098100
## sex         -0.008724784 -0.8883884 0.8709389
## qsmk:sex    -0.159478525 -2.2097583 1.8908013
```

- We have no strong evidence of effect modificaiton by sex. 

---

## Unweighted Regression vs IP Weighting 

- What if we had conditioned on every variable in `\(L\)`? 

- The stabilized weights would be 1, so we would just be running a regular 
regression. 

- If the model for `\(E[Y(a) \vert L]\)` is correct, then the regression coefficient
is interpretable as a *conditional* causal parameter. 

- So why not just use the "699 approach" and fit a regression model with all the confounders in it and interpret the coefficients?
--
- We might really want the marginal causal effect rather than the conditional causal effect. 
- It might be easier to specify a good model for `\(P[A = a \vert L ]\)` than for `\(E[Y(a) \vert L]\)`. 

---

## Censoring and Missing Data With IP Weights

- In our analysis, we have removed 63 individuals who filled in the survey in 1982 but 
who have a missing value for weight. 


&lt;table&gt;
 &lt;thead&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:right;"&gt; Quit Smoking &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:right;"&gt; Number Missing &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:right;"&gt; Percent Missing &lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 0 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 38 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 3.2 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 1 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 25 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 5.8 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

- We have more missing data for people who quit smoking than people who did not, so we could have selection bias. 


---

## Weights for Censoring

- We learned in L3 that, to correct for selection bias, we need to find a set of variables `\(L_c\)` such that `\(Y \ci C \mid A, L_c\)`. 

- We then need to estimate `\(W^C = 1/P[C = 0 \vert A, L_c]\)`. 

- We could also stabilize our censoring weights and use 

`$$SW^C = \frac{P[C = 0 \vert A]}{P[C = 0 \vert A, L_c]}$$`

- In this example, we will let `\(L_c\)` be the same set of variables we used to control for confounding, but we didn't have to make this choice. 

- The total weights will be `\(SW^C \cdot SW^A\)`


---

## Weights for Censoring

- We will estimate `\(P(C=0 \vert A, L)\)` using a logistic regression. 

- The `dat.u` data frame includes data for all participants. 


``` r
dat.u$cens &lt;- ifelse(is.na(dat.u$wt82), 1, 0)
fcal_fit &lt;- glm(
  cens ~ as.factor(qsmk) + as.factor(sex) +
    as.factor(race) + age + I(age ^ 2) +
    as.factor(education) + smokeintensity +
    I(smokeintensity ^ 2) + smokeyrs + I(smokeyrs ^ 2) +
    as.factor(exercise) + as.factor(active) + wt71 + I(wt71 ^ 2),
  family = binomial(),
  data = dat.u
)
fc0al &lt;- 1 - predict(fcal_fit, type = "response")
```

---

## Weights for Censoring

- We can estimate the numerator of the stabilized weight, `\(P(C = 0 \vert A)\)` using the average within levels of `\(A\)`. 


``` r
fca_fit &lt;-glm(cens ~ as.factor(qsmk), family = binomial(), data = dat.u)
fc0a &lt;- 1 - predict(fca_fit, type = "response")
sw.c &lt;- fc0a/fc0al
dat$sw.c &lt;- sw.c[!is.na(dat.u$wt82)]
dat$sw.comb &lt;- dat$sw*dat$sw.c
```



``` r
summary(dat$sw.c)
```

```
##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
##  0.9442  0.9782  0.9858  0.9990  1.0035  1.7180
```

``` r
summary(dat$sw.comb)
```

```
##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
##  0.3390  0.8593  0.9442  0.9974  1.0749  4.1829
```

---
## Combined Weights Results

- Below are results using the combined weights for both censoring and confounding

&lt;table&gt;
 &lt;thead&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:left;"&gt;   &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:left;"&gt; Estimate &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:left;"&gt; 95% CI &lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; Intercept &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; 1.69 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; (1.23, 2.14) &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; Quit Smoking &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; 3.4 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; (2.36, 4.45) &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

- Compared with the previous results without censoring weights:

&lt;table&gt;
 &lt;thead&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:left;"&gt;   &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:left;"&gt; Estimate &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:left;"&gt; 95% CI &lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; Intercept &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; 1.78 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; (1.34, 2.22) &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; Quit Smoking &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; 3.44 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; (2.41, 4.47) &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

---
## Survey Weights

- Typically, nationally representative surveys won't use a completely random sampling scheme. 
  + They will try to over-sample smaller groups. 
  + This allows them to get better estimates for less common covariate values. 
  
- Over-sampling introduces selection bias that needs to be corrected.

- If the survey was done well, a specific over-sampling rule was used. 
  + For example, you might select census tracts randomly according to a covariate informed probability and then select houses randomly within census tract. 
  
- This allows the survey administers to compute `\(P[ \text{In Survey} \vert L]\)` for every participant. 
  + Being in the survey is the same as *not* being censored, so we can think of this as `\(P[ C = 0 \vert L]\)`.


---
## Survey Weights

- Usually, survey administers will compute `\(P[ C = 0 \vert L]\)` and distribute `\(1/P[C = 0 \vert L]\)` as "survey weights". 

- Our censoring weight procedure requires `\(P[ C = 0 \vert A = a, L]\)`, not `\(P[C = 0 \vert L]\)`.
  - However, If `\(L\)` includes every factor affecting study inclusion, then `\(C \ci A \vert L\)`, so `\(P[C = 0 \vert L] = P[ C = 0 \vert A = a, L]\)`.

- This means we can use the same set of weights regardless of what exposure we are looking at.   


- If you have survey data that come with survey weights, be sure to read about how these are calculated. 
  + Most likely, if you want to estimate a parameter for the larger population, you will need to use the survey weights. 


---
# 3. G-Computation (Standardization)
---

## Standardization

- In standardization, we compute an estimate of `\(E[Y \vert A = a, L = l]\)` and plug it into the g-formula:

$$
E[Y(a)] = \sum_l E[Y \vert A = a, L = l]P[L = l]
$$

- If `\(L\)` is continuous, we need to integrate

$$
E[Y(a)] = \int_l E[Y \vert A = a, L = l]f(l) dl
$$

---

## Outcome Modeling

- In the standardization formula, we need to estimate `\(E[Y \vert A = a, L = l]\)`.

- For our smoking example, we will fit a linear regression


``` r
f_y &lt;-glm( wt82_71 ~ qsmk + sex + race + age + I(age * age) + as.factor(education)
    + smokeintensity + I(smokeintensity * smokeintensity) + smokeyrs
    + I(smokeyrs * smokeyrs) + as.factor(exercise) + as.factor(active)
    + wt71 + I(wt71 * wt71) + qsmk * smokeintensity,
    data = dat.u)
summary(f_y)$coefficients %&gt;% head()
```

```

```
---
## Outcome Modeling

- This first step of fitting the outcome model is just fitting a regular linear regression. 
  + In a 699-type class, this is probably where you would stop.

- We saw in our IP weighting discussion that, if we believe the model, the coefficient for treatment gives a *conditional* causal effect estimate within strata of `\(L\)`. 

- If there were no interactions between `\(A\)` and `\(L\)` in the model, the coefficient on `\(A\)` would also give the marginal treatment effect. 

  + This is only true for a linear model. It would not be true in a model with a non-linear link.


- An outcome model with no interactions assumes **homogeneity**, i.e. the average treatment effect is the same in every level of `\(L\)`. 

  + Typically, homogeneity is considered to be a very strong assumption.

---

## Outcome Modeling


- Our outcome model included an interaction between `\(A\)` and smoking intensity.

- In this model, the coefficient on `\(A\)` is the average treatment effect within strata of smoking intensity. 

- To estimate the average (marginal) treatment effect, we need to average over the distribution of smoking intensity, or more generally the distribution of `\(L\)`. 


---
## Standardizing (G-Computation)

- Fortunately, we do not need to compute `\(f(L)\)`.


- Using the definition of expectation, we can write
$$
 \int_l E[Y \vert A = a, L = l]f(l)dl = E\left[ E\left[Y \vert A = a, L = l \right]\right]
$$
- So we can estimate the standardized mean as

$$
\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n\hat{E}[Y \vert A = a, L = L_i]
$$
---

## Standardizing

- For each person, we need to compute two values `\(\hat{E}[Y \vert A = 0, L_i]\)` and `\(\hat{E}[Y\vert A = 1, L_i]\)`

- These are predicted values that we can get out of our previous regression. 

- We predict each person's outcome with `\(A = 0\)` and with `\(A = 1\)`. 


``` r
# Make two copies of the data
dat0 &lt;- dat1 &lt;- dat.u 
# In one copy everyone got treatment 0
dat0$qsmk &lt;- 0
# In the second copy everyone got treatment 1
dat1$qsmk &lt;- 1

Y0 &lt;- predict(f_y, newdata = dat0, type = "response") %&gt;% mean()
Y1 &lt;- predict(f_y, newdata = dat1, type = "response") %&gt;% mean()
cat(round(Y1, digits = 2), "-", round(Y0, digits = 2), "=", round(Y1-Y0, digits = 2))
```

```
## 5.18 - 1.66 = 3.52
```

## Censoring

- If the set of variables in our model for `\(E[Y \vert A, L]\)` are sufficient to adjust for censoring (meaning that they block all paths between `\(Y\)` and `\(C\)`), then we don't need to do anything extra to adjust for censoring.

- However, we do need to predict `\(Y(a)\)` for *all individuals* with covariate data, not just those with non-missing outcomes. 

- If `\(L\)` is not sufficient to adjust for censoring, we may need to add additional variables specifically to deal with censoring.

## Estimating the Variance 

- To compute the variance of the estimate, we need to bootstrap. 

- We will repeatedly re-sample our data with replacement. 

- Each time, we re-fit the outcome model and recompute the standardized effect. 

- The standard deviation of our bootstrap samples consistently estimates the standard error of our estimate. 

---
## Bootstrapping the Variance 

- Step 1: Write a function to compute the standardized mean

``` r
# Step 1: Write a function compute the standardized mean
std_mean_func &lt;- function(d){
   boot_fit &lt;-glm( wt82_71 ~ qsmk + sex + race + age + I(age * age) + as.factor(education)
    + smokeintensity + I(smokeintensity * smokeintensity) + smokeyrs
    + I(smokeyrs * smokeyrs) + as.factor(exercise) + as.factor(active)
    + wt71 + I(wt71 * wt71) + qsmk * smokeintensity, data = d)
  d0 &lt;- d1 &lt;- d
  d0$qsmk &lt;- 0 
  d1$qsmk &lt;- 1
  Y0 &lt;- predict(boot_fit, newdata = d0, type = "response") %&gt;% mean()
  Y1 &lt;- predict(boot_fit, newdata = d1, type = "response") %&gt;% mean()
  return(Y1-Y0)
}
```


---
## Bootstrapping the Variance 

- Step 2: Repeatedly re-sample the data and compute the standardized mean in the re-sampled data set. 


``` r
set.seed(1)
samples &lt;- replicate(n = 500,
                     expr = sample(seq(nrow(dat.u)), 
                                   size = nrow(dat.u), replace = TRUE))
res &lt;- apply(samples, 2, FUN = function(ix){
  boot_dat &lt;- dat.u[ix,]
  boot_est &lt;- std_mean_func(boot_dat)
  return(boot_est)
})
se &lt;- sd(res)
eff &lt;- Y1-Y0
ci &lt;- eff + c(-1, 1)*qnorm(0.975)*se 
cat(round(eff, digits = 2), "(", round(ci, digits = 2), ")")
```

```
## 3.52 ( 2.58 4.46 )
```

## Effect Modification in G-Computation

- If we want to estimate the average causal effect stratified by `\(V\)`, we can simply stratify by `\(V\)` before averaging our predicted values. 

- Here we look at effect modification by sex:


``` r
dat.u$Y0 &lt;- predict(f_y, newdata = dat0, type = "response") 
dat.u$Y1 &lt;- predict(f_y, newdata = dat1, type = "response")
dat.u %&gt;% group_by(sex) %&gt;% 
      summarize(Y0 = mean(Y0), Y1 = mean(Y1))
```

```
## # A tibble: 2 × 3
##     sex    Y0    Y1
##   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1     0  1.66  5.30
## 2     1  1.66  5.06
```

- We could get bootstrap confidence intervals for these estimates as well.

## IP Weighting vs G-Computation

- If all of our models are fully saturated, IP weighting and standardization give exactly the same result (recall HW1). 

- With parametric models, the two methods rely on different assumptions and are not the same.

- In the IP weighted analysis, we need to trust our model for `\(f(A \vert L)\)`.

- In the standardized analysis, we need to trust our model for `\(E[Y \vert A, L]\)`. 

- In either case, if  our parametric models are wrong, our predictions will be biased and so our estimators will be biased. 

- It can be a good idea to compute both and compare.
  + If results are very different, at least one of the two models is wrong.

## IP Weighting vs G-Computation

- Chatton et al (2020) present simulation results comparing IPW, G-computation, and two methods we haven't talked about yet. 

- In their simulation scenario, G-computation always had a lower MSE than IPW 

- For IPW, they calculated variance using robust SEs (as we did earlier) and found slight over coverage (~97% for a 95% target). 

- They used parametric simulation to compute the variance of the G-computation estimate. This gave close to target coverage but slightly under in some cases (~94%).

## IP Weighting vs G-Computation

- Snowden et al (2010) describe G-Computation as rarely used in epidemiology due to lack of awareness. 

- However, G-Computation can be more precise than IP weighting in some circumstances. 

  + IP weighting can be inefficient when weights are very large. 
  
  
- Vansteelandt and Keiding find that IPW performs better when the covariate distribution is very different in cases and controls. 
  + Depending on the model used fo G-Computation, the dominant group may have too much influence over estimates in these regions. 
  + G-Computation may under-estimate the uncertainty about the counterfactuals in these regions. 
  
  
- Some  suggest that we shouldn't be trying to estimate the countefactuals in these regions at all, since this requires extrapolating into regions with low data density.
