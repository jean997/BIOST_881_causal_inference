## Effect Modification Example

- Suppose we have a binary treatment $A$ and a binary outcome $Y$. 

- Suppose $V$ is a binary variable representing a pre-existing co-morbidity.

- We want to know if treatment $A$ has the same effect in patients with $V=1$ and patients with $V = 0$.

## Effect Modification Example

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
set.seed(1)
n <- 1000
V <- rep(c(0, 1), each = n/2)
p_v0 <- c(0.1, 0.3,0.4, 0.2) #Prob of (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1)
p_v1 <- c(0.1, 0.5, 0.2, 0.2)
Y_V0 <- sample(1:4, size = n, prob = p_v0, replace = TRUE)
Y_V1 <- sample(1:4, size = n, prob = p_v1, replace = TRUE)

Y <- Y_V0
Y[V == 1] <- Y_V1[V == 1]

Y0 <- as.numeric(Y %in% c(3, 4))
Y1 <- as.numeric(Y %in% c(2, 4))
df <- data.frame(V = V, Y0 = Y0, Y1 = Y1) %>% group_by(V, Y0, Y1) %>% summarize(n = n())
kable(df, col.names = c("\\(V\\)",  "\\(Y(A=0)\\)", "\\(Y(A=1)\\)", "\\(N\\)"), format = 'html') %>%
   row_spec(4, extra_css = "border-bottom: solid;")
```

$$E[Y(1) \vert V = 0] - E[Y(0) \vert V = 0] = `r round(mean(Y1[V ==0]), digits = 2)` - `r round(mean(Y0[V == 0]), digits = 2)` = `r round(mean((Y1-Y0)[V==0]), digits = 2)`$$
$$E[Y(1) \vert V = 0] - E[Y(0) \vert V = 1] = `r round(mean(Y1[V ==1]), digits = 2)` - `r round(mean(Y0[V == 1]), digits = 2)` = `r round(mean((Y1-Y0)[V==1]), digits = 2)`$$


---

## Effect Modification Definition

- Variable $V$ is a *modifier* of the effect of $A$ on $Y$ if the causal effect differs over strata of $V$.

- Effect modification does not care about mechanism. 
  
    + $V$ does not need to mechanistically alter the effect of $A$.
    + $V$ does not even need to be causally related to $Y$.

- Effect modification depends on the choice of effect measurement.

---

## Additive and Multiplicative Modification

- Additive effect modification:

$$
E[Y(1) \vert V = 1] - E[Y(0) \vert V = 1] \neq \\
E[Y(1) \vert V = 0] - E[Y(0) \vert V = 0] 
$$

- Multiplicative effect modification:

$$
\frac{E[Y(1) \vert V = 1]}{E[Y(0) \vert V = 1]} \neq \frac{E[Y(1) \vert V = 0]}{ E[Y(0) \vert V = 0]}
$$
--

- Does additive modification imply multiplicative modification? What about vice-versa?

---

## Types of Effect Modification

1. The causal effect has the same direction in all levels of $V$.

  - There may be effect modification only on the additive scale or only on the multiplicative scale.
  
1. The causal effect is exactly zero in at least one stratum of $V$.

  - If this type of effect modification is present on one scale, it will be present on the other. 

1. The causal effect has different signs in different strata of $V$ (*qualitative modification*). 

  - If this type of effect modification is present on one scale, it will be present on the other. 

---

## Effect Modification in DAGs

- Effect modification is hard to represent in DAGs.

- There is no DAG feature that always corresponds to effect modification. 

- Effect modifiers are always connected to the outcome by an open path.

---

## Effect Modification in DAGs

- In all of the DAGs below, $V$ could be a modifier of the effect of $A$ on $Y$.

- In the third graph, $W$ is in the conditioning set.
  + Why is $V$ associated with $Y$?

- In graphs 2 and 3, $V$ is a *surrogate effect modifier* because $V$ does not directly cause $Y$. 

---

## More on Effect Measures

- If there is a non-zero effect of $A$ on $Y$ in at least one stratum of $V$ and $E[Y(a) \vert V]$ varies with $V$ for some value of $a$ then 
  
- $V$ <u>always</u> modifies the effect of $A$ on $Y$ on either the additive or multiplicative scale (or both).
  
- Hernán and Robins argue that the additive scale is preferable.


---


## Transportability

+ The ATE is the average effect in the population being sampled.

+ An effect estimate is *transportable* if it is a good estimate for the effect in other populations

+ Differences in effect modifiers between populations could lead to lack of transportability.

--

+ Example: 
  - In our population $P[V = 1] = 0.5$. 
  - Average risk difference among those with $V = 0$ is -0.1.
  - Average risk difference among those with $V = 1$ is 0.3.
  - What wold be a good effect estimate for a population in which everyone has $V = 0$?
  - How about a population in which $P[V = 1] = 0.25$?

--

+ There are no guarantees modifiers are transportable either.

---
## Example

- There are genetic variants that increase susceptibility to nicotine addiction. 

- In populations with easy access to smoking tobacco, these variants increase risk of lung cancer.

- Tobacco access is an effect modifier.

- Without accounting for tobacco access, our causal effect estimate is not transportable.

                          )

sm <- create_graph(nodes_df = sm_node, edges_df = sm_edge)

render_graph(sm)
```

</center>

## Other Reasons to Care About Effect Modification

-  We might be interested in identifying subpopulations with the most to gain from an intervention. 
  + Should we only treat patients with $V = 1$?
  
- In some cases, identifying effect modifiers can provide information about the 
mechanism of the causal effect. 
  - In the genetic example, knowing that tobacco access modifies the effect may help us conclude that the genetic variant affects lung cancer because it affects smoking behavior.

---

## Identifying Counterfactual Means in Subgroups

- To characterize effect modification, we need to estimate $E[Y(a) \vert V = v]$. 

- Under what conditions is $E[Y(a) \vert V = v]$ identifiable?

--

- If $E[Y(a)]$ is identifiable then $E[Y(a) \vert V = v]$ is identifiable.


- Recall the four conditions for identifying $E[Y(a)]$:
--

  + Consistency
  + No interference
  + Positivity - must hold within strata of $V$
  + Conditional exchangeablity, conditional on observed variables $L$


---

## Estimating Counterfactual Means in Subgroups

We can use a two step estimation procedure:

1. Stratify the data by $V$.

2. Use standardization or IP weighting with $L$ to estimate the expected counterfactual within each level of $V$.


---

## Standardization for Subgroup Effects

- The standardized mean of $Y(a) \vert V = v$ is


$$
E[Y(a) \vert V = v] = \sum_{l}E[Y(a) \vert  V = v, L = l]P[L = l \vert V = v]
$$
$$
 = \sum_l E[Y \vert A = a, L = l, V = v]P[L = l \vert V = v]
$$ 
---

## IPW for Subgroup Effects 
- Or equivalently, the IPW mean:

$$
E[Y(a) \vert V = v] = E \left[\frac{I(A = a)Y}{f_{A \vert L, V =v}(A, L)} \Big\vert V = v\right ]
$$
- We simply compute the IPW mean within strata defined by $V$.

## Example

                     x = c(1, 0, 1, 0.5),

                          )

## Example

If we knew the full counterfactuals, we could compute the conditional effects directly

kable(XX, col.names = c("\\(V\\)", "\\(N\\)","\\(\\bar{Y}(0)\\)", "\\(\\bar{Y}(1)\\)", "\\(\\bar{Y}(1)-\\bar{Y}(0)\\)"), format = 'html', row.names =FALSE) 
```


$$E[Y(1) \vert V = 0]- E[Y(0) \vert V = 0] = `r round(mean((X$Y1-X$Y0)[X$V ==0]), digits = 2)`$$
$$E[Y(1) \vert V = 1]- E[Y(0) \vert V = 1] = `r round(mean((X$Y1-X$Y0)[X$V ==1]), digits = 2)`$$

---

## Example 

To estimate conditional causal effects in the observed data, we make use of the fact that $Y(a) \ci A \vert L$ to compute the standardized means.

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
X <- X %>% mutate(Y = case_when(A == 0 ~ Y0, TRUE ~ Y1))
Ta <- X %>% group_by(L, V, A) %>% summarize(N = n(), Y = round(mean(Y), digits = 2)) 

T0 <- X %>% group_by(L, V, A) %>% summarize(N = n(), Y = mean(Y)) 

 S <- X %>% group_by(L, V) %>% summarize(N = n(), Y0 = mean(Y0), Y1 = mean(Y1), N = n(), diff = mean(Y1-Y0))
 plgivenv = S[, 1:3] %>% mutate(Vtot = case_when(V == 0~ sum(S$N[S$V == 0]), 
                                                 TRUE ~  sum(S$N[S$V == 1])), p = N/Vtot, 
                                pr = round(p, digits = 2))
 
t1 <- kable(Ta[Ta$A==0,], col.names = c("\\(L\\)", "\\(V\\)","\\(A\\)", "\\(N\\)", "\\(\\bar{Y}\\)"), format = 'html', row.names =FALSE) %>%
  kable_styling(position = "float_left", full_width = FALSE)

t2 <- kable(Ta[Ta$A==1,], col.names = c("\\(L\\)", "\\(V\\)","\\(A\\)", "\\(N\\)", "\\(\\bar{Y}\\)"), format = 'html', row.names =FALSE)%>%

```

$$P[L = 0 \vert V = 0] = \frac{`r S$N[1]`}{`r S$N[1] + S$N[3]`} = `r round(S$N[1]/( S$N[1] + S$N[3]), digits = 2)`$$ 

$$
\begin{split}
\hat{E}[Y(1) \vert V = 0] = & E[Y \vert A = 1, V = 0, L = 0 ] P[L = 0 \vert V = 0] + \\

$$ \hat{E}[Y(1) \vert V = 0] = `r round(Ta$Y[2]* plgivenv$p[1] + Ta$Y[6]*plgivenv$p[3], digits = 2)` $$

\end{split}
$$


$$\hat{E}[Y(1) \vert V = 0]-\hat{E}[Y(0) \vert V = 0] = `r round((Ta$Y[2]* plgivenv$p[1] + Ta$Y[6]*plgivenv$p[3])-(Ta$Y[1]* plgivenv$p[1] + Ta$Y[5]*plgivenv$p[3]), digits = 2)`$$


---

## Special Case: V = L

- If $Y(a) \ci A \vert L$ and we are also interested in effect modification by $L$, we can skip the step of computing the standardized mean. 

- Instead, we simply stratify by $L$ and compute $E[Y(a) \vert L = l] = E[Y \vert A = a, L = l]$. 

- These are the *stratified* means. 



```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
Ta <- X %>% group_by(L,  A) %>% summarize(N = n(), Y = round(mean(Y), digits = 2)) 


kable(Ta, col.names = c("\\(L\\)", "\\(A\\)", "\\(N\\)", "\\(\\bar{Y}\\)"), format = 'html', row.names =FALSE) %>%
  kable_styling(position = "center", full_width = FALSE)

```

## Special Case: V = A

- If there is effect modification by treatment status, the causal effect among those who received treatment $A=1$ is different from the causal effect among those who received treatment $A = 0$. 

- The *average treatment effect among the treated* (ATT) is 
$$
E[Y(1) \vert A = 1] - E[Y(0) \vert A = 1]
$$
- Note that if the ATT is different from the ATE, this implies that unconditional exchangeability ( $Y(a) \ci A$ ) does not hold. 

  + Why?

## Average Effect Among the Treated

```
</center>

---

## Identifying the ATT

- To identify the ATT, we don't need full conditional exchangeability which says that 
$$ Y(a) \ci A \vert L$$ for all $a$. 

- We only need *partial exchangeability*: $Y(0) \ci A \vert L$

--

- Equivalently, to identify the average effect among the non-treated, we need $Y(1) \ci A \vert L$.

- Generally, to identify $E[Y(a) \vert A = a^\prime]$ we need $$ Y(a) \ci A \vert L$$ for all $a \neq a^\prime$.

---

## Standardization to Estimate the ATT

- From our previous expression for the conditional standardized mean

$$
E[Y(a) \vert A = 1] = \sum_l E[Y(a) \vert L=l, A = 1 ]P[L = l \vert A = 1]
$$

--

- From consistency we know
$$E[Y(1) \vert L = l, A = 1] = E[Y \vert L = l, A = 1]$$
--

- From partial exchangeability, we know that
$$
E[Y(0) \vert L = l, A = 1] = E[Y(0) \vert L = l]
$$
--

- Consistency again:

$$ E[Y(0) \vert L = l] = E[Y \vert L = l, A = 0]$$
--

- So

$$
E[Y(a) \vert A = 1] = \sum_l E[ Y \vert L=l, A = a ]P[L = l \vert A = 1]
$$

---
## ATT Example

In the simulated data example, the average effect among the treated is

$$
E[Y(1) \vert A = 1] = `r round(with(X, mean(Y1[A == 1])), digits = 2)`\\\
E[Y(0) \vert A = 1] = `r round(with(X, mean(Y0[A == 1])), digits = 2)`\\\
E[Y(1)-Y(0) \vert A = 1] = `r round(with(X, mean((Y1-Y0)[A == 1])), digits = 2)`
$$
To estimate these values using standardization we compute


```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
Ta <- X %>% group_by(L,  A) %>% summarize(N = n(), Y = round(mean(Y), digits = 2)) 

plgivena = Ta[, 1:3] %>% mutate(Atot = case_when(A == 0~ sum(Ta$N[Ta$A == 0]), 
                                                 TRUE ~  sum(Ta$N[Ta$A == 1])), 
                                p = N/Atot, 
                                pr = round(p, digits = 2))
kable(Ta, col.names = c("\\(L\\)", "\\(A\\)", "\\(N\\)", "\\(\\bar{Y}\\)"), format = 'html', row.names =FALSE) %>%
  kable_styling(position = "float_left", full_width = FALSE)

```

$$
P[L = 0 \vert A = 1] = `r round(plgivena$p[2], digits = 2)`\\\
P[L = 1 \vert A = 1] = `r round(plgivena$p[4], digits = 2)`
$$


$$
\hat{E}[Y(1) \vert A = 1] = `r round(Ta$Y[2], digits = 2)`\cdot `r plgivena$pr[2] ` + 
`r round(Ta$Y[4], digits = 2)`\cdot `r plgivena$pr[4] ` = `r round((Ta$Y[2]*plgivena$p[2]) +(Ta$Y[4]*plgivena$p[4])  , digits = 2)`\\\
\hat{E}[Y(0) \vert A = 1] = `r round(Ta$Y[1], digits = 2)`\cdot `r plgivena$pr[2] ` + 
`r round(Ta$Y[3], digits = 2)`\cdot `r plgivena$pr[4] ` = `r round((Ta$Y[1]*plgivena$p[2]) +(Ta$Y[3]*plgivena$p[4])  , digits = 2)`
$$

## Matching

- Matching is an alternative method to adjust for confounders $L$. 

- For each person receiving $A = 1$, we identify a "match" with the same value of $L$ who received $A = 0$. 
  + We leave aside the rest of the data. 
  
- In the resulting matched population, the distribution of $L$ is the same in the $A=1$ and $A =0$ cohorts. 

- Since we matched to the $A = 1$ cohort, we are now able to estimate the ATT as $E_m[Y \vert A = 1] - E_m[Y \vert A = 0]$ where the expectation is with respect to the matched population. 

- Alternatively, we could have matched to the $A = 0$ cohort, or to a different distribution of $L$.

# 2. Interactions

---

## Interactions Describe Joint Interventions

- An *interaction* between variables refers to relationships between joint counterfactuals.

- We say that there is an additive interaction between $A$ and $E$ if 

$$E[Y(A = 1, E = 0)] - E[Y(A = 0, E = 0)] \neq \\E[Y(A = 1, E = 1)] - E[Y(A = 0, E = 1)].$$

- Like effect modification, interaction depends on the effect measure. 
  + There may be an additive but not a multiplicative interaction or vice versa.

---
## Interactions in DAGs

- Like effect modification, interactions are hard to clearly indicate in DAGs. 

- In order for an interaction between $A$ and $E$ to occur, $Y$ must be 
a descendant of both $A$ and $E$. 


<center>
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="45%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/3_swig_ix.png")
```
</center>

---
## Example

- $Y$ indicates whether or not the lamp is on.

- $A$ indicates if there is a bulb in the lamp.

- $E$ indicates if the lamp is plugged in. 

- The lamp is on if it is pulgged in and has a bulb:  $Y(1, 1) = 1$

- Otherwise it is off: $Y(1, 0) = Y(0, 1) = Y(0, 0) = 0$. 

- There is an interaction because $Y(1, 0) - Y(0, 0) = 0$ and $Y(1, 1) - Y(0, 1) = 1$. 
  + Adding a bulb is effective if the lamp is plugged in but otherwise is ineffective.

---

## Identifying Interactions

- In order to identify an interaction, we must be able to identify $Y(a, e)$ for all values of $a$ and $e$. 

- We need our usual four identification criteria, but they need to apply to the joint counterfactual. 

- Consistency: $A_i = a$ and $E_i = e$ $\Rightarrow$ $Y_i = Y_i(a, e)$.

- Positivity: $P[A = a, E=e \vert L = l] > 0$ for all $a$, $e$, $l$.

- Exchangeability: $Y(a, e) \ci A, E \vert L$


- If these hold, we can estimate $E[Y(a, e)]$ using the same standardization or IPW strategy we used for single interventions. 
---

## Effect Modification vs Interaction

- When $Y(a, e) \ci A, E$, we have 
$$
E[Y(a, e)] = E[Y(a) \vert E = e] = E[Y(e) \vert A = a]= E[Y \vert A=a, E=e]
$$

- So interaction between $A$ and $E$ implies that $E$ is a modifier of the effect of $A$ on $Y$.

- Or equivalently, $A$ is a modifier of the effect of $E$ on $Y$. 

- If we are only willing to assume $Y(a) \ci A \vert L$, then we can identify modification but not interaction. 

---

# 3. Collapsibility

---
## Collapsibility

- An association measure is *collapsible* with respect to a variable $Z$ if the measure in the entire population is equal to a weighted average of the measure within strata.

- The average treatment effect and risk ratio are collapsible: 
$$
E[Y(1)] - E[Y(0)] = \sum_{z}(E[Y(1) \vert Z=z]-E[Y(0) \vert Z=z])P[Z=z]
$$

$$
\frac{E[Y(1)]}{E[Y(0)]} = \sum_z \frac{E[Y(1) \vert Z=z]}{E[Y(0) \vert Z=z]}w_z
$$
$$
w_z = \frac{E[Y(0)\vert Z=z]P[Z=z]}{E[Y(0)]}
$$
- For ATE and RR, if we know strata specific effects, we know the possible range of the population effect. 

- This is not the case for the odds ratio. 

---
## Collapsibility of Association Measures

- Effect measures are functions of the counterfactual distribution. 

- Association measures are functions of distribution of the observed data. 

- $E[Y(1)] - E[Y(0)]$ is an effect measure. $E[Y \vert A = 1] - E[Y \vert A = 0]$ is an association measure.

- The same definition of collapsibility applies to association measures.

- If $g(P(a, y))$ is an association measure, then $g$ is collapsible over $Z$ if
  $$g(P(a, y)) = \sum_z g(P(a, y \vert z))w(z) $$
  where $w(z) \geq 0$ and $\sum_z w(z) = 1.$

---

## Strict Collapsibility 

- An association measure is strictly collapsible over $A$ if $g(P(a, y \vert z)) = g(P(a, y))$ for all values of $z$.

- Strict collapsibility says that the association measure is the same within strata as in the population.


---

## Collapsibility and Confounding

- One definition of confounding says that if $g(P(a, y \vert z)) \neq g(P(a, y))$, then $Z$ is a confounder and we should adjust for it. 

- Is this definition correct if $g$ is the risk difference?

- What about risk ratio?

- What about odds ratio? 


---

## Collapsibility and Confounding

**Theorem:** If $g$ is the risk difference, faithfulness holds, and $g$ is strictly collapsible over $Z$ then $A$ and $Y$ are unconfounded by $Z$.

- The reverse is not true, if $g$ is not strictly collapsible over $Z$, we can't conclude that $Z$ is a confounder. 

- This theorem does not hold for the odds ratio.
